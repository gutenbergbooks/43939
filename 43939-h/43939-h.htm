<p class="chaptitle">Introduction.</p>

<p>The history of the United States, according to newer
views which have largely supplanted, or progressed beyond,
those of the New England school of great historians,
is the history of the march of a civilization, chiefly English,
across the vast North American continent, within the
short period of three hundred years. It is the story of the
transformation of a wide-stretching wilderness—of an ever-advancing
frontier—into great cities, diversified industries,
varying social interests, and an intensely complex life.
Wave upon wave of races of mankind has flowed over the
developing and enlarging West, and each has left its impress
on that area. Across the trail of the Indian and the
trapper, the highway of the pioneer on his westward
journey, have spread the tilled fields of the farmer, or
along it has run the railroad. The farm has become a
town-site and then a manufacturing city; the trading post
at St. Paul and the village by the Falls of St. Anthony
have expanded into the Twin Cities of the Northwest; the
marshy prairie by the side of Lake Michigan, where the
Indians fought around old Fort Dearborn, has come to be
one of the world’s mighty centers of urban population—and
all this transformation within the memory of men
now living.</p>

<p>The progress of this rapid, titanic evolution of an empire
was greatly accelerated by the desires, the strength,
and the energy of multitudes of immigrants from Europe;
and in at least six great commonwealths of the Northwest
the Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes have been among the
chief contributors to State-building. During the eighty
years ending in June, 1906, among the 24,000,000 immigrants
who came to the United States, the Scandinavians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
numbered more than 1,700,000. Whether viewed as emigrations
on the eastern shores of the Atlantic, or as immigrations
on the western shores, these modern <i>Völkerwanderungen</i>
constitute one of the wonders of the social world,
in comparison with which most of the other migrations in
history are numerically insignificant. The Israelites
marching out of Egypt were but a mass of released bond-men;
the invasions of the Goths, Vandals, and Huns were
conquering expeditions, full of boisterous, thoughtless,
unforecasting energy. Even the immigration from Europe
to America in the whole of the seventeenth century scarcely
equalled in number the columns which moved westward in
any one year from 1880 to 1890.</p>

<p>In this flux of humanity, mobile almost to fluidity,
various in promise of utility, shifting in proportions of the
good and bad, of pauper, refugee, and fanatic, or “bird of
passage”, sweatshop man, and home-builder, there has been
such an interplay of subtle and vast forces that no just
and final appreciation can as yet be reached. But some
sort of tentative conclusions may be arrived at by intensive
study of each immigrant group, following it through years
and generations, searching for its ramifications in the body
politic and social.</p>

<p>The student of this phase of American history must
attempt the scientific method, and exercise the patience, of
the student of physical nature. No geologist, for example,
would think for a moment of generalizing as to the history
and the future of a continent of complicated structure
after a few examinations here and there of cross-sections
of its strata. He must know from thoro-going observation
the trend, thickness, and composition of each stratum; he
must trace, if possible, the sources of the material which he
finds metamorphosed; he must be familiar with the physical
and the chemical forces at work in and on this material,—heat,
pressure, movement, affinities, gases, water, wind,
and sun. In like manner, the student of immigration as
a whole, or of a section as large as that of the Scandinavians
or Italians, must make careful discriminations as to previous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
conditions and influences, and also must notice carefully
the differentiation of peoples, places, and times.</p>

<p>Too much stress, however, should never be laid on the
character of any one group of immigrants, lest it warp the
judgment upon the immigration movement as a factor in
American progress. The ardent political reformer in New
York City, seeing the political activity of the Irish, and the
easy, fraudulent enfranchisement of newly-arrived aliens,
cries in a loud voice for restriction or prohibition of immigration.
The California labor agitator, feeling chiefly the
effect of Chinese efficiency in the labor market, would close
the gates of the country to all the eastern nations. The
social worker, knowing mainly and best the degradation of
the Hungarians in the mines, or of the Hebrews in the
sweatshops, prophesies naught but evil from foreign immigration.
From an opposite point of view, when a man
travels in leisurely fashion up and down Wisconsin, Illinois,
Minnesota, and the Dakotas, and finds a dozen race
elements—English, German, Norwegian, or Russian—he
begins to understand the real benefit to the nation of the
coming of this vast, varied, peaceful army.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The scale of
immigrants runs from the pauper or the diseased alien,
awaiting deportation on Ellis Island in New York Harbor,
to the rich Norwegian or German owning a thousand-acre
farm in North Dakota, and to the millionaire Swedish lumberman
or manufacturer of Wisconsin or Minnesota.</p>

<p>For more than half a century, the United States has
been almost a nation of immigrants, a mixture of races in
the process of combination; upon the exact nature of this
combination, whether it take the form of absorption, amalgamation,
fusion, or assimilation, depends future political
and social progress.</p>

<p>The writer has for years felt a profound conviction of
the vital importance of this whole problem of the alien, and
a corresponding belief in the value of the investigation of
each cohort in the national forces. Hence this attempt at a
sympathetic study of the Scandinavian element in American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
life and of its contributions to the evolution of the
Northern Mississippi Valley during the last sixty years.</p>

<p>In such a study, the Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes,
like all other citizens of foreign birth, must be judged by
the character and preparation which best fit men to contribute
to the permanent progress of a self-governing people.
What are the signs of readiness for full Americanization?
The fundamentals are manliness—Roman virility—,
intelligence, and the capacity for co-operation, ennobled
by “dignified self-respect, self-control, and that self-assertion
and jealousy of encroachment which marks those
who know their rights and dare maintain them”;<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> devotion
to law, order, and justice; and a ready acquiescence in the
will of the majority duly expressed.<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Such qualities in America have been the especial possession
of that sub-race of the Caucasian stock which the
later ethnologists call the Baltic, in contradistinction to
the co-ordinate sub-races, the Alpine, and the Mediterranean
or Ligurian. This Baltic race has for centuries occupied
the British Isles, the northern plains of Germany, and
the North European peninsulas, being found in its purest
state in Norway, Sweden, and Scotland. The people of this
sub-race, asserts the writer of an admirable article on racial
characteristics, are mentally “enterprising and persevering,
and cheerfully dedicate most of their time and thought to
work.... They are liberally gifted with those moral instincts
which are highly favorable to the creation and
growth of communities, altho not always so favorable to
the individual who possesses them; they are altruistic, fearless,
honest, sincere. They love order and cleanliness, and
attach considerable importance to the dress and personal
appearance of individuals.”<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> While the other Caucasian
sub-races do not lack these qualities, their most dominating
characteristics are different; for example, one may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>exemplify the artistic or the idealistic side of human
nature.</p>

<p>As related to the progress of civilization in America,
all immigrants fall into three classes: those who powerfully
re-enforce the strength and virtue of the nation, those who
supplement its defects with desirable elements, and those
who lower its standards and retard its advancement.
Hence, those immigrants will be presumably the most
desirable to America who come from the regions where the
purest Baltic stock now exists, that is, north of a line running
east and west through Brussels, and especially in
north-central Germany and the Scandinavian peninsula.</p>

<p>Measured by character and training, the Baltic race
in America stands up well to the test, not only in the foreign-born
alone, but in the second and third generation
born on American soil. If generations of ignorance, mental
inertia, social depression, political passivity, shiftlessness,
and improvidence stretch behind the immigrant, if his
religion be chiefly a superstition or strongly antagonistic
to the principles of the Republic, and if he be physically
inferior and long inured to the hardships of a low standard
of living, just so far is he an undesirable addition to
American population. But, on the other hand, if his homeland
show a very low percentage of illiteracy; if his life
has been saturated with the ideas of thrift and small
economies; if he hold himself free from domination by
priest, landlord, or king; and if his history be the story
of a sturdy struggle for independence, he should be rated
high and welcomed accordingly, for it is of such stuff that
mighty nations are made.</p>

<p>The student of Scandinavian immigration in the nineteenth
century is not left to conjecture in his endeavor to
estimate the probable result of the injection into American
society of this foreign-born element. Before the second
generation of English and Dutch settlers in America in
the seventeenth century had grown to manhood, the
Swedes began a colony upon the Delaware River; and their
descendants are still a distinguishable part of the population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the lower Delaware valley. This beginning of
Swedish immigration to America is particularly instructive
because the settlements undertaken in the period of the
Thirty Years War drew their recruits from the same classes
of Swedish society as the movements of the nineteenth century,
and developed under substantially similar conditions
and along much the same lines.</p>

<p>The Swede of the seventeenth century and the Swede
of the nineteenth century are essentially one in character,
for two hundred years have wrought less change in him
than in his cousins of Germany and England. The accounts
of Stockholm, its people and its surroundings, written in
the early seventeenth century, might serve, with very little
modification, to describe the large features of the Sweden
and the Swedes of today. Great progress has of course been
made in two centuries, but in political wisdom, high moral
courage, and benevolent purpose, Gustavus Adolphus and
his advisers were distinctly in advance of the first two
English Stuarts and their courts.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better illustration of this difference could
be found than in the plans for the beginnings of the colonies
on the James River and on the Delaware River. The
scheme for a colony on the Delaware was originally outlined
by the great Gustavus himself in 1624, but sterner
duties took his energies; and after the fatal blow on the
field of Lützen, it devolved on his daughter, Queen Christina,
and her faithful minister, Oxenstjerna, to carry
out his plan for establishing a colony which was to be “a
blessing to the common man,” a place for “a free people
with wives,” and not a mere commercial speculation or a
haven for aristocratic adventurers and spendthrifts.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The first company of immigrants arrived in 1638, and
year by year additions were received. So early as the middle
of the seventeenth century, Sweden had a touch of the
“America fever,” and when an expedition left Gothenburg
in 1654 with 350 souls on board, about a hundred families
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>were left behind for want of room. Perhaps only the transfer
of the colony, first to the Dutch and then to the English,
prevented the Swedish immigration from attaining large
proportions two and a half centuries ago. The Swedish
flag floated over New Sweden notwithstanding the protests
of both the Dutch and the English, until the conquest of
the colony by Governor Stuyvesant in 1655, and then it
disappeared from the map of America.</p>

<p>In spite of threats, subjugation, and isolation, the
prosperity of the early colony continued, and by the end
of the seventeenth century it numbered nearly a thousand.
No injustice in dealing with the Indians provoked a massacre,
for these protégés of the Swedish crown, before William
Penn was born, carefully and systematically extinguished
by purchase the Indian titles to all the land on
which they settled. Their piety and loyalty built the church
and fort side by side, and long after they became subjects
of the king of Great Britain they continued to receive their
ministers from the mother church in Sweden. In fact,
pastors commissioned from Stockholm did not cease their
ministrations until they came speaking in a tongue no
longer known to the children of New Sweden.</p>

<p>This Swedish colony, planted thus in the midst of larger
English settlements, continued for many generations to
add its portion of good blood and good brains to a body of
colonists in the New World, which too often needed sorely
just these qualities. The Honorable Thomas F. Bayard,
who lived long among their descendants, wrote in 1888:
“I make bold to say that no better stock has been contributed
(in proportion to its numbers) towards giving a solid
basis to society under our republican forms, than these
hardy, honest, industrious, law-abiding, God-fearing Swedish
settlers on the banks of the Christiana in Delaware.
While I have never heard of a very rich man among them,
yet I have never heard of a pauper. I cannot recall the
name of a statesman or a distinguished law-giver among
them, nor of a rogue or a felon. As good citizens they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
helped to form what Mr. Lincoln called the plain people
of the country,—and I have lived among their descendants
and know that their civic virtues have been transmitted.”<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Their thrift and comfort and sobriety attracted the attention
of Thomas Pascall, one of the Englishmen of Penn’s
first colony, who wrote in January, 1683: “They are generally
very ingenious people, live well, they have lived here
40 years, and have lived much at ease having great plenty
of all sorts of provisions, but they were but ordinarily
cloathed; but since the English came they have gotten fine
cloathes, and are going proud.”<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Penn himself declared:
“They have fine children and almost every house full; rare
to find one of them without three or four boys and as many
girls; some six, seven and eight sons. And I must do them
right—I see few young men more sober and industrious.”<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes</p>


<p>The common use of the term Scandinavian to describe
Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes in a broad and general
way, is one of the products of the commingling of these
three peoples on the American side of the Atlantic. The
word really fits even more loosely than does the word British
to indicate the English, Welsh and Scotch. It was
applied early in the history of the settlements in Wisconsin
and Illinois, to groups which comprised both Norwegians
and Danes on the one hand, or Norwegians and Swedes on
the other hand, when no one of the three nationalities was
strong enough to maintain itself separately, and when the
members of one were inclined, in an outburst of latent
pride of nationality, not to say conceit of assumed superiority,
to resent being called by one of the other names; for
example, when a Norwegian objected to being taken for a
Swede. Thus the Scandinavian Synod of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church, organized in 1860, included both Norwegians
and Danes; ten years later the name was changed to
the Norwegian-Danish Conference; and in 1884 the differentiation
was carried further, and the Danes formed a new
Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association, supplementing
the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, which dated back to 1871.</p>

<p>Vigorous protests were made from time to time against
the use of “Skandinavian” or “Skandinav.” “Shall we
Norwegians let the Danes persist in calling us Scandinavians?”
wrote “Anti-Skandinavian” to the leading American
Norwegian weekly of 1870.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He also quoted the sarcastic
words of Ole Bull: “Scandinavia, gentlemen,—may
I ask where that land lies? It is not found in my geography;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>does it lie perhaps in the moon?”<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But the use and
acceptability of the word steadily grew; the great daily
paper in Chicago took the name <i>Skandinaven</i>; in 1889, the
editor of <i>The North</i> declared: “The term has become a
household word ... universally understood in the sense in
which we here use it (to designate the three nationalities).”<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Ole Bull was, of course, right in saying that there is no
Scandinavian language, no Scandinavian nation; but the
ordinary reader or student does not recognize clearly that
Sweden, Norway and Denmark have different spoken
languages (though the Danish and Norwegian printed
language is one), different traditions, as well as different
governments. Almost while these words are being written,
the coronation ceremony in the ancient cathedral at
Throndhjem completes the process by which Norway is
severed entirely from Sweden and again assumes among the
powers of earth that “separate and equal station to which
the laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them.”</p>

<p>The physique and characteristics of the three Scandinavian
peoples have been profoundly affected by the physical
features of the northern peninsulas; the mountains,
fjords, and extensive coast lines of Norway, the level
stretches, lakes, and regular coast of Sweden, and the low,
sandy islands of Denmark find a counterpart in the varying
types of men and women of those countries. The occupations
which necessarily grew out of these differences of surface
and soil tended to give to all a strong, sturdy, hardy
body; farming naturally claims by far the largest percentage,
though great numbers of the men yield to the call of the
sea. Both Norway and Sweden have large lumbering interests,
while Norway leads in fishing industries, Sweden in
mining, and Denmark in dairying.</p>

<p>Nature is no spendthrift in any part of the Scandinavian
peninsulas; small economies are the alphabet of her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>teaching, and her lessons once learned are rarely forgotten.
Her children of the North, therefore, down to the stolidest
laborer, mountaineer, and fisherman, are generally industrious
and frugal, and when they migrate to the American
West, to enter upon the work of pioneering, with its stern
requirements of endurance, patience, persistent endeavor,
and thrift, they start out in the new life with decided temperamental
advantages over most other immigrants, and
even over most native-born Americans.</p>

<p>Other characteristics common to these three peoples
distinguish them strikingly from the South European.
From their Viking ancestors they have inherited a love for
adventure, a courage in facing the possibilities of the future.
Their hatred of slavery, and their clear, high ideas
of personal and political freedom, are strongly marked,
and their peasantry is ranked highest on the continent.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Their adaptability to changes of clime, of conditions, of circumstance,
has been remarkably demonstrated over and
over again, in Normandy in the 11th century, in Sicily in
the 12th, and in America in the 19th; yet it has not degenerated
into a facile yielding to moods and whims even under
the rapid changes of New World society.</p>

<p>The typical Swede is aristocratic, fond of dignities,
assertive: he is polite, vivacious, and bound to have a jolly
time without troubling too much about the far future. Yet
he is not afraid of hard work; he is persistent, ofttimes
brilliant, and capable of great energy and endurance. He
is notably fond of music, especially the singing of choruses
and the opera, and the poetry of Bellman and the epics
of Tegner belong to the great literature of the world.</p>

<p>The Norwegian is above all democratic. He is simple,
serious, intense, severe even to bluntness, often radical and
visionary, and with a tendency to disputatiousness.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> There
is an unmeasured quantity of passion and imagination in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>him, as there are unmeasured stores of power and beauty
in the snows of his mountains and the waters of his coast.
He has the capacity for high and strenuous endeavor, even
verging on the turbulent, but he rarely has developed the
qualities of a great leader. Like the Swede, the Norwegian
is fond of music, but it is of a different sort. Both in his
music and in his literature, the dramatic element is strong;
no names in the realm of literature of the last generation
stand higher than those of Ibsen and Björnson, who are
first cosmopolitan and then Norwegian.</p>

<p>The Dane is the Southerner of the Scandinavians, but
still a conservative. He is gay, but not to excess; the
healthiness and jollity of a Copenhagen crowd are things to
covet. He is pre-eminently a small farmer or trader, honest
and persevering, ready and easy-going, and altho not
given to great risks, he is quick to see a bargain and shrewd
in making it. Of self-confidence and enterprise he manifests
a decided lack.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> His country is small, open on all
sides, and near to great Powers; his interests, therefore,
have led him out from his peninsula and islands, and foreign
influences have more affected him than they have his
neighbors across the Sound and the Skager Rack. His best
work in literature and art has been done under strong
Romantic and classic impulses from the South.</p>

<p>Such being the qualities of the peoples of Sweden,
Denmark and Norway, the conditions of life and society in
those countries in the first half of the nineteenth century
seem on close examination quite unlikely to produce a
great emigration, in comparison with conditions in other
countries from which large numbers of men and women
migrated to America. There were no great social, economic,
or political upheavals sufficient to cause the exodus of
any class; religious intolerance and persecution were, with
few minor exceptions, neither active nor severe. The
Napoleonic wars did not depopulate these northern lands,
nor did they, like their sister nations to the south, suffer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>seriously from the commercial restrictions of the Emperor
of the French. Militarism did not crush them with its
weight of lead and steel and its terrible waste of productive
energy. Political oppression and proscription, so marked
in the affairs of central and western European states down
to 1850, were not features of the history of Norway,
Sweden or Denmark. Though Norway protested in 1814
in no uncertain terms against the union with Sweden in
a dual monarchy, she was, under the constitution of that
year, one of the freest nations of Europe, “a free, individual,
indivisible kingdom.” In Sweden before 1840, one
of the chief restrictions on the individual was potential
rather than actual: a man who wished to leave the kingdom
must have a passport from the king, for which he had to
pay 300 kroner (about $81). He would also be under the
close supervision of the state church, to which he was
expected to belong.</p>

<p>There were, however, conditions in the home-lands
as well as in America, which impelled immigration. Anyone
who has travelled over the fertile prairies of the Mississippi
valley and then through Norway or Sweden, will
often wonder that so many people have been content to
remain so long in the older Scandinavia. In Norway there
were in 1910, in round numbers, 2,390,000 people on an
area of 124,000 square miles.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Of this population, about
425,000 were gathered in the larger towns, and 250,000
were in the smaller towns, making a total urban population
of 29%, over against 21% twenty years before. The remainder
were scattered over the vast mountainous country
or along the coast-line of three thousand miles.<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Thousands
of fishermen’s huts are grappled barnacle-like to the
rocks, while behind them along a trickling thread of water
stretches a precious hand-breadth of soil. The greater
part of the interior is one wide furrowed plateau, in whose
hollows, by lakes and streams, thrifty farmers skilfully
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>utilize their few square yards of tillable land and pasture
their cattle on the steep slopes. Save around Lake Mjösen,
the Leir, Vos, and Throndhjem, there can scarcely be found
in all Norway anything like a broad rich meadow. The
farm products are almost literally mined from the rocks.
“It is by dogged, persistent, indomitable toil and endurance,
backed up in some cases by irrepressible daring, that
the Norwegian peasant and fisher-folk—three-fourths of
the population—carry on with any show of success their
struggle against iron nature.”<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Yet in spite of such adverse
conditions, these people have ever clung with passionate
tenacity to their mountainous storm-beaten Norway, and
by it have been made brave without bitterness, hardy without
harshness, strong yet tender.</p>

<p>In Sweden the physical conditions are decidedly different.
The area of 172,900 square miles supports a population
of 5,600,000 (1912), of whom 50% dwell in cities of
which there are now thirty with more than 10,000,
Stockholm leading with 350,000. The urban population
increased 166% between 1871 and 1912.<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> There are few
lofty mountains and no jagged peaks, majestically dominating
the outlook; the crag-set fjords are replaced by
gentler bays and sounds sprinkled with beautiful islands;
in some parts of the country, as in Wermland and Smaaland,
are low and marshy sections, where, according to
legend, the Lord forgot to separate the land and water.
Agricultural conditions are less hard and means of communication
are better than in Norway; closer relations
exist between provinces and between parishes; information
is more readily diffused, and gatherings of considerable size
are held without particular difficulty.</p>

<p>Denmark more closely resembles Sweden than Norway,
and is in still better touch with the larger world
than either of the others. With an area of about 15,000
square miles,—Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>combined—it held in 1911 a population of 2,775,000.
Copenhagen and its suburbs had a population of 560,000.
The urban population was 26%. Unlike the other two,
Denmark has several important colonies in other parts of
the world.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In all three countries, as in the rest of Europe,
changes in commercial, industrial, social, legal, and religious
matters were sure to be slow. The tenure and succession
in lands, the limited market for labor, the relatively
small opportunity for initiative, especially for the younger
members of considerable families,—all of these conditions
with the characteristics already described, lent added attractiveness
to the call of the American West.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">Early Norwegian Immigration.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>“Arrived last evening” (October 9, 1825).</p>

<p>“Danish Sloop Restoration, Holland, 98 days from
Norway, via Long Island Sound, with iron to Boorman
and Johnson, 52 passengers.”<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“The vessel is very small, measuring, as we understand,
only about 360 Norwegian lasts, or 45 American
tons, and brought 46 passengers, male and female, all
bound for Ontario County, where an agent who came over
sometime since, purchased a tract of land.”<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These ordinary shipping notices in the newspapers
of New York City, and several other similar paragraphs,
are the first entries in the chronicles of the newer Scandinavian
immigration to the United States. From the cessation
of Swedish immigration in the seventeenth century
down to 1825, no considerable companies made the long
journey from the Northlands to America, tho adventurous
fellows in twos and threes came now and then, men
who misliked the humdrum life in the old parishes, with its
narrow opportunity and outlook, men who found the sea
the only highway to novelty and a possible fortune.<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Now,
at last, the coming of a company of some size, from Norway,
adding one more to the lengthening list of nationalities
which contributed to the complex population of
the United States, attracted more than passing attention.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>That the sloop was not Danish, and that there is some discrepancy
in the number of passengers—(and crew?)—and
in the number of days in the voyage, are minor matters
and easily accounted for; the New Yorker of 1825
could hardly be expected to distinguish clearly between
Danes and Norwegians, when the people of the Northwest
at the present time apply the name Swede indiscriminately
to Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, Finns, and Icelanders.
But back of the arrival of this little sloopful of Norwegians,
is a story of motive, organization, and movement,
more or less characteristic of Scandinavian immigration
during the next two generations. The two main elements
are: conditions in Norway and the United States, and the
personal activities of one of the adventurous fellows already
referred to.</p>

<p>In the region about Stavanger, in southwestern Norway,
in 1825, there had been for some time a feeling of
discontent with the religious conditions of the country,
and a tendency to formal dissent from the established
church. The direction of this tendency and the definition
of the movement were vitally influenced by certain zealous
and philanthropic Quaker missionaries from England,
Stephen Grellet and William Allen, who visited Norway in
1818. Grellet was a French nobleman who sought refuge
in the United States during the French Revolution, and
there united himself with the Quakers or Friends. After
residing in America for twelve years, he began making
tours through Europe to propagate Quaker ideas, even
obtaining an interview with the Pope, which he describes
in his diary. The visit to Norway was in furtherance of
his general plan. While his account of his stay in Norway
does not make any mention of America, it is impossible to
believe that no reference to America and to the conditions
of the Friends in that part of the world, where he himself
found refuge, crept into the conferences which he held
around Stavanger, and that no seeds of desire to seek the
New World were sown in the slow-moving minds of the
Norwegian peasants whom he met.<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>As dissenters from the established church, these Quakers
were continually subject to actual or threatened pains
and penalties, in addition to those troubles which might
arise from their refusal to take oaths and to render military
service. Their children and those of other dissenters
must he baptised and confirmed in the Lutheran Church;
they must themselves attend its services and pay taxes for
its support, or suffer fines or other punishment for failing
so to do. Tho prosecutions, or persecutions, were really
few before 1830, an episode now and then showed the dissenters
what might be in store for them if they persisted,
as when one of the Quakers was arrested in 1821 for burying
his children in unconsecrated ground, and fined five
specie dollars a day until he re-bury them in consecrated
ground, and agree to follow the outward ceremonies and
customs of the state church.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Two years before one of the
Friends wrote: “There are no laws yet made in favor of
Friends, so that those who stand firm in their principles
act contrary to the laws of the country. Friends must be
resigned to take the consequences.”<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> With signs of persecution,
with an increase of discontent, and with the leadership
of a man possessed of first-hand knowledge about the
United States, it is not surprising that emigration was
decided upon.</p>


<p>Kleng Peerson, called also Kleng Pederson and Person
Hesthammer, was a man of dubious character, who has
been variously described. One has called him the “Father
of the Newer Norwegian Immigration” and as such entitled
to a chapter by himself; another has written him down
as a tramp.<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A softer characterization, however, makes of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>him a “Viking who was born some centuries after the
Viking period.”<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He appears to have been a sort of
Quaker, either from conscience or convenience. His leaving
his home parish of Skjold near Stavanger, and his
emigration to the United States in 1821 in company with
another Norwegian, are attributed to motives ranging from
a commission from the Quakers to find a refuge for them in
America, to a desire to escape the rich old widow whom he
married, and who was tired of supporting him in idleness.<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Certain it is that upon his return to Norway in
1824, after three years of experience in the New World, the
sentiment favoring emigration from Stavanger soon crystallized.</p>

<p>By midsummer of 1825 a company of fifty-two persons,
mostly Quakers from the parish of Skjold, was ready to
journey to America. They purchased a sloop and a small
cargo of iron which would serve as ballast and which might
bring them profit in New York, tho this was probably a
secondary matter.<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> On the 4th of July, 1825, they set sail
from Stavanger, and after a somewhat circuitous voyage of
fourteen weeks, which was not very long, as such voyages
went, they made their landing in New York, October 9th,
numbering fifty-three instead of fifty-two, for a daughter
was born to Lars Larson on shipboard.<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This landing of
the “Sloop Folk” of the “Restoration,” whose story is a
favorite and oft-told one with the older Norwegian immigrants,
is occasionally likened to the Landing of the Pilgrim
Fathers who fled to a wilderness to escape persecution
and to seek social and religious freedom; but on close
examination the comparison breaks down at almost every
point,—motive, objective, method and result.<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In New York the captain and mate of the “Restoration”
were arrested for having more passengers than the
Federal law allowed—two passengers to each five tons of
the vessel. Having an excess of twenty, the sloop was
legally forfeited to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> However, for some
unknown reason, the offenders were released and allowed
to dispose of their cargo. The original cost of ship and
cargo appears to have been about $1950, but both were sold
for $400. This inadequate sum was supplemented by the
generosity of the Quakers of New York, whose contributions
and assistance enabled the “Sloop Folk” to proceed
inland to Western New York.</p>

<p>They took up land in Kendall and Orleans County on
the shores of Lake Ontario, about thirty-five miles northeast
of the new town of Rochester in which two of the families
decided to remain. The price of the land was $5 per
acre, and each man was to take about 40 acres; but as they
were without cash, they agreed to pay for their farms in
ten annual instalments. The reasons for selecting this
region are not difficult to surmise, tho there is no direct
proof of the motive. The country around Rochester was,
in 1825, in the midst of a sort of Western “boom”; the Erie
Canal was just finished, and the prospects of Rochester
were very promising.<a id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Its population grew quite marvelously;
in September, 1822, it was 2700; in February, 1825,
4274; and in December of the same year, nearly 8,000.<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The first five years of the little colony were full of
hardships and suffering. It was November of 1825 when
they reached their destination; the country was all new and
thinly settled; their own land was wild and could be cleared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>only with difficulty; and nothing could be grown upon it
before the following summer. Just one man among them,
Lars Larson, understood any English. By united efforts
several families built a log-house, where the winter was
spent in a most crowded condition, worse even than the
three months in the close quarters of the “Restoration”.
The only employment by which they could earn anything
was threshing with a flail in the primitive fashion of the
time, and the wages consisted of the eleventh bushel
threshed. With these scanty earnings and the help of
kindly neighbors, they passed the dismal winter in a
strange land. “They often suffered great need, and wished
themselves back in Norway, but they saw no possibility of
reaching Norway without sacrificing the last mite of their
property, and they would not return as beggars.”<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But at
length time, patience, and their own strength and diligence
gave them a foothold. The land was cleared and produced
enough to support them. A five years’ apprenticeship made
them masters of the situation; and when at last they had
the means to return to the parish of Skjold, the desire had
gradually faded out. Instead of re-migration, they were
persuading others to join them in the New World.</p>

<p>But the New Norway, or the New Scandinavia, was
not to be located in the Middle Atlantic States, though a
beginning was made in Delaware and in New York. Land
was too dear around the older settlements even at $5 per
acre; the promised land was shifted to northern Indiana
and northern Illinois, where fine prairie tracts which
needed no clearing could be had for $1.25 per acre and
upwards. And into these newer regions went the settler
and the land speculator, sometimes in one and the same
person. Schemes for internal improvement sprouted on
every side, and canal-building was much discussed as the
best means of providing cheap transportation.<a id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> One of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>these projects was for a canal from Lake Michigan to the
Illinois River, for which a land grant was made in 1827.
This canal would bring great prosperity to northern Illinois,
it was argued, just as the Erie Canal had developed
central and western New York; the price of land would go
up, markets would be accessible, and speculator and farmer
would reap rich rewards.</p>

<p>Nor was this argument based entirely on theory, for
halfway to the East, in Indiana, this progressive realization
was in full blast. Harriet Martineau travelled through this
part of the West in 1836, and noted with the eye of an
acute and experienced observer, the rapid rise in values of
farms. She estimated that a settler, judiciously selecting
his land in the Northwest, would find it doubled in a single
year, and cites the case of a farmer near LaPorte, Indiana,
whose 800 acres, costing him $1.25 per acre three years
before, had become worth $40 per acre—probably not a
unique example of prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> With these visions before
them, many men moved from western New York, and along
the line of the proposed canal in Illinois grew up hamlets
bearing the names familiar along the great Erie Canal,—Troy,
Seneca, Utica, and Lockport.</p>

<p>Among those attracted thither, was Kleng Peerson,
who again served, perhaps without deliberate planning, as
a scout for his Quaker friends.<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> On his return to the
Orleans County settlers, he convinced them that a better
future would open to them in Illinois, and in the spring of
1834 some of the families moved into the West and began
the so-called Fox River settlement in the town of Mission
near Ottawa, La Salle County, Illinois. By 1836 nearly
all the Norwegians of the New York colony had removed
to the West, and several tracts of land were taken up in the
towns of Mission, Miller, and Rutland. The sections located
seem to have been unsurveyed at the time of the first
settlement, for no purchases are recorded until 1835.<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Henceforth most of the immigration from Norway was
turned toward the prairie country, and whole companies
of prospective settlers after 1836 went directly to the Fox
River nucleus, for the region thereabouts had the double
advantage of being at once comparatively easy of access
and in the most fertile and promising region in which government
land could be had at the minimum price.</p>

<p>In its new location, the twice transplanted colony of
“Sloop Folk” was reasonably prosperous from the start,
tho the panic of 1837 made impossible any realization
of Miss Martineau’s roseate estimate of probable profits.
No further move of the original immigrants was made,
and the Fox River Valley is still occupied by the well-to-do
descendants of the Norwegian settlers of the thirties.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to further immigration from the
three countries of Northern Europe, a definite knowledge
of America and its opportunities must be developed among
the peasants, and a desire to remove themselves thither
must be awakened and stimulated. To whole communities
in Norway, made up of simple, circumscribed people,
America about 1835 was an undiscovered country, or at
best a far-off land from which no traveller had ever come,
and from which no letters were received; the name itself,
if known at all, was a recent addition to their vocabulary.
Ole Nattestad, one of the early immigrants, who was
decently educated for his time and more experienced in
the world than the majority of his neighbors, relates how
he first heard of America in 1836, when he was a man
thirty years old.<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The leavening process went on but slowly from 1825
to 1836, for the story of the early experiences of the little
company of dissenters, obscure persons from an obscure
parish, if known at all, was not likely to inspire others to
follow in large numbers. With increasing prosperity in
the Rochester, and later in the Fox River, colony, the tone
of letters sent back to friends in Norway took a new ring:
America came to mean opportunity, and now there were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>men speaking the Norwegian tongue to whom newcomers
might go for instruction, advice, and encouragement. Old
settlers still bear witness to the great influence of these
letters of the thirties telling of American experiences and
of American conditions. Among the most influential of
these semi-conscious propagandists of emigration was
Gjert G. Hovland, who came to the Rochester settlement
with his family in 1831, and bought fifty acres of land,
which after four years of cultivation he sold at a profit of
$500. Writing to a friend near Stavanger in 1835, he spoke
in terms of high praise of American legislation, equality,
and liberty, contrasting it with the extortion of the Norwegian
official aristocracy. He counseled all who could to
come to America, as the Creator had nowhere forbidden
men to settle where they pleased.<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Of this and other
letters by Hovland, copies were made by the hundred and
circulated in the Norwegian parishes, and many of the
early immigrants have stated that they were induced to
emigrate by reading these letters.<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Another man whose
words prompted to emigration, was Gudmund Sandsberg,
who came to New York in 1829 with a family of four.<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>These letters scattered through western Norway from
1830 to 1840, were as seed sown in good ground. Times
were hard; money was scarce and its value fluctuating.<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The crops were often short, the prices of grain were high,
and the demand for the labor of the peasants was weak; the
economic conditions of the lower classes, especially in the
rural districts—much the greater part of the country—were
growing worse rather than better.<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Even the oldest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>son, who was heir to his father’s homestead, was likely to
find himself possessed of a debt-burdened estate and with
the necessity of providing for the mother and numerous
younger children.<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The younger sons, being still worse
off, were forced to try their hands at various occupations
to earn a bare living. Ole Nattestad, already mentioned,
was by turns before his emigration farmer, peddler, blacksmith,
and sheep-buyer.<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> To many a man with a large
family of growing children the possibility of disaster in the
United States was less forbidding than the probability of
ultimate failure in Norway.</p>

<p>But not to occasional letters alone was the peasant,—and
the emigration movement—to be left for information
and inspiration. Young men who had prospered in the
new life returned to the homesteads of their fathers and
became, temporarily, missionaries of the new economic
gospel, teaching leisurely but effectively by word of
mouth and face to face, instead of by written lines at long
range. One such man was Knud A. Slogvig, who returned
to his home in Skjold in 1835 after ten years in America,
not as an emigrant agent nor as a propagandist, but as a
lover to marry his betrothed,—an early example which
thousands of young Scandinavians in the years to come
were to follow gladly.<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Whatever may have been the results
of his visit to Slogvig personally, they were of far-reaching
importance to the emigration movement in western
Norway. From near and from far, from Stavanger,
from Bergen and vicinity, and from the region about
Christiansand, people came during the long northern
winter, to talk with this experienced and worldly-wise man
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>about life in New York or in Illinois—or, in their own
phrase, “i Amerika.” There before them at last, was a
man who had twice braved all the terrors of thousands of
miles of sea and hundreds of miles of far-distant land, who
had come straight and safe from that fabulous vast country,
with its great broad valleys and prairies, with its
strange white men, and stranger red men. The “America
fever” contracted in conferences with Slogvig and men of
his kind, was hard to shake off.<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The accounts of America given by this emigrant visitor
were so satisfactory, that when he prepared to go back to
the United States in 1836, a large party was ready to go
with him. Instead of the fifty-two who slipped out of
Stavanger, half-secretly in 1825, there were now about 160,
for whose accommodation two brigs, <i>Norden</i> and <i>Den
Norske Klippe</i>, were specially fitted out.<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The increased
size of this party was doubtless due in some measure to
discontent with the religious conditions of the kingdom,
but more to the activity of Björn Anderson Kvelve, who
desired to escape the consequences of his sympathy with
Quakerism, and of the marriage which he, the son of a
peasant, had contracted with the daughter of an aristocratic,
staunchly Lutheran army officer.<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Being, as his
son admits, “a born agitator and debater”—others have
called him quarrelsome,—he persuaded several of his
friends to join the party, and he soon became its leader.<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The greater part of the two ship-loads, after arrival in
New York, went directly to La Salle County, Illinois, a few
stopping in or near Rochester. For several years after
the arrival of this party, the immigrants from Norway
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>generally directed their course towards the Illinois settlement,
which, as a result, grew rapidly and spread into the
neighboring towns of Norway, Leland, Lisbon, Morris,
and Ottawa.</p>

<p>The actual process of migration from Norway to Illinois
or Wisconsin was full of serious difficulty, and to be
entered upon by those only who possessed a strong determination
and a stout heart. The dangers, discomforts, and
hardships which everywhere attended immigration before
1850, were made even more trying, in prospect, by the
weird stories of wild Indians, slave-hunters, and savage
beasts on land and sea, all of which were thoroly believed
by the peasants. Moreover, the church took a hand
to prevent emigration, the bishop of Bergen issuing a pastoral
letter on the theme: “Bliv i Landet, ernær dig
redelig.” (Remain in the land and support thyself honestly.)<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Until a much later time, no port of Norway or
Sweden had regular commercial intercourse with the United
States, and only by rare chance could passage be secured
from Bergen or some southern port direct to New York or
Boston. The usual course for those desiring passage to
America was to go to some foreign port and there wait for
a ship; it was good luck if accommodation were secured
immediately and if the expensive waiting did not stretch
out two or three weeks. The port most convenient for the
Norwegians was Gothenburg in Sweden, from which cargoes
of Swedish iron were shipped to America; from that
place most of the emigrants before 1840 departed, tho
some went by way of Hamburg, Havre, or an English port.</p>

<p>Long after 1850, the immigrants came by sailing vessels
because the rates were, on the whole, cheaper than by
steamer; those men who had large families were especially
urged to take the sailing craft.<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The days of emigrant
agents, through-tickets, and capacious and comparatively
comfortable steerage quarters in great ocean liners were far
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>in the future; the usual accommodations were poor and
unsanitary; the danger from contagious diseases, scurvy,
and actual famine were very real, especially if the voyage,
long at the best, was prolonged to four and perhaps five
months.<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The cost of passage varied greatly according
to accommodations and according to the port of departure.
Sometimes the passage charge included food, bedding, and
other necessaries, but usually the passengers were required
to furnish these. One company of about 85 in 1837 paid
$60 for each adult, and half fare for children, from Bergen
to New York.<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In the same year another company of 93
paid $31 for each adult from Stavanger to New York,
without board; still another, numbering about 100, paid
$33 1-3 for each adult passenger from Drammen in Norway
to New York; the Nattestad brothers paid $50 from Gothenburg
to Boston.<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In 1846, a large party went to Havre,
and paid $25 for passage to New York.<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The extreme
figures, therefore, seem to be about $30 and $60 for passage
between one of the Scandinavian ports and New York or
Boston. When the cost of transportation from the Atlantic
seaboard to Illinois and Wisconsin is added to these
figures, it will be plain that a considerable sum of
ready cash, as well as strength and courage, was necessary
for undertaking the transplantation of a whole family from
a Norwegian valley in the mountains to an Illinois prairie.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">The Rising Stream of Norwegian Immigration.</p>


<p>The second period of Norwegian immigration, extending
from 1836 to 1850, is marked by the strengthening and
deepening of the emigration impulse in Norway and by its
spread to new districts, and also by the deflection of the
course of the rising stream in the United States. Not
merely in the vicinity of Stavanger, from which a second
party, made up of 93 persons from Egersund, followed the
wake of the first and reached Illinois in 1837, but from Bergen
and in the districts near it, the “America fever” was
spreading. The letters of Hovland circulated there, and
at least three men journeyed to interview Slogvig. Knud
Langeland, whose little book on the Northmen in America
is frequently quoted in these pages, relates how, as a young
man of sixteen, his imagination was fired by reading a
small volume written by a German and entitled <i>Journey
in America</i>, which he discovered in the library of a friend
in Bergen in 1829; how he read eagerly for several years
everything which he could lay hands on relating to America;
and how he gathered all possible information about
the emigration from England, during a visit to that country
in 1834—and then became himself an immigrant.<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>By 1837 a goodly number were determined to emigrate,
and had disposed of their holdings of land. A way
opened for them to make the long voyage under especially
favorable circumstances. Captain Behrens, owner and
commander of the ship <i>Ægir</i>, on his return to Bergen in the
autumn of 1836, learned that a large party wanted transportation
to America. In New York he had seen vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>fitted up for the English and German immigrant traffic;
he had learned the requirement, of the laws of the United
States on the subject; two German ministers who returned
to Europe in his ship, gave him further information. He
therefore fitted up his vessel for passengers, and carried
out his contract to transport to New York the party which
finally numbered 84, being mainly made up of married
men each with “numerous family,” at least one of which
counted eight persons.<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> From New York the company
proceeded to Detroit, where they were joined by the two
Nattestad brothers from Numedal, and from thence they
went by water to Chicago.</p>

<p>Their original intention was to go to the La Salle
County settlement, but in Chicago they met some of the
Fox River people, Björn Anderson among others, who
gave such an unfavorable account of conditions in that
colony that the majority determined to seek another location.
At the instigation of certain Americans, presumably
land speculators, a prospecting party of four, including
Ole Rynning, one of the leading spirits of the company,
went into the region directly south of Chicago and finally
chose a site on Beaver Creek. Thither about fifty immigrants
went, and began the third Norwegian settlement,
which proved to be the most unfortunate one in the history
of Norwegian immigration. Log huts were built and the
winter passed without unusual hardships, tho it was
soon evident that a mistake was made in settling so far
from neighbors and from a base of supplies at that time of
the year when the soil produced nothing. Serious troubles,
however, developed with the spring, and grew with the
summer. The land which appeared so dry and so well-covered
with good grass when it was selected and purchased
in August or September, proved to be so swampy
that cultivation was impossible before June. Malaria
attacked the settlers, and as they were beyond the reach of
medical aid, nearly two-thirds of them died before the end
of the summer. The remnant of the colony fled as for their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>lives, regardless of houses and lands, and scarcely one of
them remained on the ground by the end of 1838.<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>One of the victims of these hard experiences was Ole
Rynning, who succumbed to fever in the autumn of 1838.
Tho in America scarcely a year and a half, he is one of
the uniquely important figures in the history of Norwegian
immigration. The son of a curate in Ringsaker in central
Norway, and himself dedicated by his parents to the church,
he passed the examinations for entrance to the University
of Christiania, but turned aside to teaching in a private
school near Throndhjem for four years before his emigration.<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
He is invariably spoken of as a man of generous,
philanthropic spirit, genuinely devoted to the human needs
of his fellow immigrants.</p>

<p>Having learned by personal observation in America
the answers to many of the questions which he, as a man
of education, had asked himself in Norway, he took advantage
of the confinement following the freezing of his
feet during a long exploring tour in Illinois, to write a little
book of some forty pages, to which he gave the title (in
translation): “A true Account of America, for the Instruction
and Use of the Peasants and Common people, written
by a Norwegian who arrived there in the Month of June,
1837.”<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The manuscript of this first of many guidebooks
for Norwegian emigrants was taken back to Norway by
Ansten Nattestad and printed in Christiania in 1838.<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It
plays so large a part in a great movement, that a detailed
analysis is worth presenting.</p>

<p>The preface, bearing the author’s signature and the
date, “Illinois, February 13, 1838,” is translated as follows:</p>

<p>“Dear Countrymen,—Peasants and Artisans! I have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>now been in America eight months, and in that time I have
had an opportunity of finding out much in regard to which
I in vain sought information before I left Norway. I then
felt how disagreeable it is for those who wish to emigrate
to America to be in want of a reliable and tolerably complete
account of the country. I also learned how great is
the ignorance of the people, and what false and ridiculous
reports were accepted as the full truth. In this little book
it has, therefore, been my aim to answer every question
which I asked myself, and to clear up every point in regard
to which I observed that people were ignorant, and to
disprove false reports which have come to my ears, partly
before I left Norway, and partly after my arrival here.”<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The body of the book is made up of thirteen chapters
devoted to these questions and their answers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1-3. The location of America, the distance from Norway,
the nature of the country, and the reason why
so many people go there.</p>

<p>4. “Is it not to be feared that the land will soon be
overpopulated? Is it true that the government
there is going to prohibit immigration?”</p>

<p>5-6. What part of the land is settled by Norwegians,
and how is it reached? What is the price of land,
of cattle, of the necessaries of life? How high
are wages?</p>

<p>7. “What kind of religion is there in America? Is
there any sort of order and government, or can
every man do what he pleases?”</p>

<p>8-9. Education, care of the poor, the language spoken
in America, and the difficulties of learning it.</p>

<p>10. Is there danger of disease in America? Is there
reason to fear wild animals and the Indians?</p>

<p>11. Advice as to the kind of people to emigrate, and
warning against unreasonable expectations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>12. “What dangers may be expected on the ocean?
Is it true that those who are taken to America are
sold as slaves?”</p>

<p>13. Advice as to vessels, routes, seasons, exchange of
money, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rynning assured his readers, in the seventh chapter,
that America is not a purely heathen country, but that the
Christian religion prevails with liberty of conscience, and
that “here as in Norway, there are laws, government, and
authority, and that the common man can go where he
pleases without passport, and may engage in such occupation
as he likes.”<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Then follows this strong, significant
paragraph, intelligently describing the slavery system,
which undoubtedly had a powerful influence on the future
location, and hence on the politics, of the immigrants from
Scandinavia:</p>

<p>“In the Southern States these poor people (Negroes)
are bought and sold like other property, and are driven to
their work with a whip like horses and oxen. If a master
whips his slave to death or in his rage shoots him dead, he
is not looked upon as a murderer.... In Missouri the slave
trade is still permitted, but in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin
Territory it is strictly forbidden, and the institution
is strictly despised.... There will probably soon come a
separation between the Northern and Southern States or a
bloody conflict.”</p>

<p>From the account given thirty years afterwards by
Ansten Nattestad, it appears that a chapter on the religious
condition of Norway was omitted by the Rev. Mr. Kragh
of Eidsvold, who read the proofs, because of its criticisms
of the clergy for their intolerance, and for their inactivity
in social and educational reforms.<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This has led some writers
like R. B. Anderson to attribute large weight to religious
persecution as a cause of emigration. While religious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>repression was a real grievance and affected many of the
early emigrants, the cases where it was the moving or
dominant cause of emigration after 1835 are so few as to be
almost negligible.<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> At best, it re-enforced and completed
a determination based on other motives. For most Norwegian
dissenters, the Haugians for example, lack of toleration
was rather an annoyance than a distress, save, perhaps,
for the more persistent and turbulent leaders.<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It is
hardly fair, therefore, to compare them, as a whole, with
the Huguenots of France.<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the years immediately following 1838, the “America
Book,” distributed from Christiania, went on its missionary
journeys and reached many parishes where the disaster at
Beaver Creek and the untimely death of Ole Rynning had
never been heard of. By its compact information and its
intelligent advice, it converted many to the new movement.
The diary of Ole Nattestad, printed in Drammen in the
same year, seems to have exerted very little influence, but
the visit of his brother Ansten to his home in Numedal, in
east-central Norway, a hitherto unstirred region, awakened
keen and active interest in America, and again men travelled
as far as 125 English miles to meet one who had returned
from the vast land beyond the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The first party from Numedal left Drammen in the
spring of 1839, under the leadership of Nattestad, and went
directly to New York. It numbered about one hundred
able-bodied farmers with their families, some of them being
men with considerable capital. From New York they
went to Chicago, expecting to join Ole Nattestad at the Fox
River. At the latter city they learned that he had gone
into Wisconsin after his brother left for Norway in 1838,
and that he had there purchased land in the township of
Clinton in Rock County, thus being probably the first Norwegian
settler in Wisconsin. Accordingly the larger part
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>of the Numedal party followed him to the newer region,
where better land could be had than any remaining in La
Salle County, Illinois, at the minimum price, and took up
sections near Jefferson Prairie. Thus the current of Scandinavian
settlement was deflected from Illinois to Wisconsin,
and later comers from Numedal, in 1840 and afterwards,
steered straight for southeastern Wisconsin. In
1839 and later other recruits for the growing and prosperous
settlement of Norwegians in Rock County and adjoining
counties came from Voss and the vicinity of Bergen.
Possibly the difference of dialects had something to do
with drawing people from the same province or district
into one settlement, but in a general way the same reasons
and processes operated among the Norwegian emigrants
as among those from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia who settled in various States in sectional groups,
sometimes dividing a county by a well-defined line.</p>

<p>Closely connected with this settlement, begun under
the leadership of the Nattestad brothers, were other settlements
in adjacent townships,—at Rock Prairie or Luther
Valley, comprising the present towns of Plymouth, Newark,
Avon, and Spring Valley in Rock County, Wisconsin,
and Rock Run in Illinois. Through these settlements many
new comers filtered and spread out rapidly toward the West
and Northwest, reaching in a few years as far as Mineral
Point, more than fifty miles from Jefferson Prairie.</p>

<p>Other sections of Norway than those already mentioned
began to feel the effects of the emigration bacillus
after 1837, and the processes illustrated by the movements
from Stavanger, Bergen, and Numedal were repeated—the
emigration of two or three, letters sent home, the return
of a man here and there, the organization of the party, the
long journey, and the selection of the new home. Thelemark,
the rugged mountainous district in south central
Norway, was in a condition to be strongly moved by
stories of freer and larger opportunities. Long before
1837, great tracts of land in Upper Thelemark became the
property of two wealthy lumber men, and the tenant-farmers
were drawn more and more into work in the lumber<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mills, to the neglect of farming and grazing. Consequently,
when logging was suspended in the hard times, and
the wages, already low, were stopped altogether, great distress
resulted, and emigration seemed about the only means
of escape. “With lack of employment and with impoverishment,
debt and discontent appeared as the visible evidences
of the bad condition. That was the golden age of the
money-lenders and sheriffs. So the America fever raged,
and many crossed the ocean in the hope of finding a bit of
ground where they could live and enjoy the fruits of their
labors without daily anxiety about paydays, rents, and
executions.”<a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>A company of about forty, representing eleven families
from Thelemark, failing to get accommodations with
the Nattestad party at Drammen, went on to Skien and
thence to Gothenburg, where they secured passage in an
American vessel loaded with iron, and made the voyage
to Boston in two months.<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Three weeks more were consumed
in the circuitous journey to Milwaukee by way of
New York, Albany, the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes.
Like several other parties of that year they originally aimed
at Illinois.<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But their boat “leaked like a sieve,” and the
stop at Milwaukee was probably precautionary. Instead
of proceeding further, they were persuaded to send a committee,
under the guidance of an American, into the present
county of Waukesha, where they selected a tract about
fourteen miles southwest of Milwaukee, on the shore of
Lake Muskego.<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Here each adult man took up forty acres
at the usual minimum price of $1.25 per acre, and so began
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>the Muskego colony proper, the name, Muskego, however,
being later applied to the group of settlements in Waukesha
County and to several towns in Racine County.<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Like
the colony in Rock County, the Muskego group grew
rapidly in spite of malarial troubles, and for ten years it
was an objective point for immigrants from Thelemark,
and a halting place for those bound for the frontier farther
west in Wisconsin or in Iowa.</p>

<p>As the emigration movement from Norway increased,
the planning of settlements and the organization of parties
took on a more definite and business-like air. The process
is well illustrated in the case of the town of Norway in
Racine County, Wisconsin, which was one of the most
successfully managed settlements in the Northwest. In
the fall of 1839, two intelligent men of affairs, Sören Bakke,
the son of a rich merchant of Drammen, and John Johnson
(Johannes Johannesson), came to America on a prospecting
tour, for the purpose of finding a place where they
might invest money in land as a foundation for a colony,
which they may possibly have intended to serve as a new
home for a sect of dissenters known as Haugians.<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> After
visiting Fox River in Illinois, and various locations in
Wisconsin, they found a tract that suited them—good land,
clear water, and abundance of game and fish, enough to
satisfy the most fastidious. This they purchased, building
a cabin on it and awaiting the coming of their friends to
whom they sent a favorable report.<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The party arrived in
the autumn of 1840, under the leadership of Even Heg, an
innkeeper of Leir, who brought still more money, which
was also invested in land. Altogether, the money which
Bakke brought with him, or received later, amounted to
$6000.<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It was all used for purchasing land, which was
either sold to well-to-do immigrants, or leased to new comers.
This business was supplemented by a store kept in
the first cabin. Upon the death of Johnson in 1845, Bakke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>went home and settled upon an estate owned by his father
in Leir, one of the first of the very small number of men
who have returned to permanent residence in Norway after
some years spent in America.<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Even Heg became the real
head of the colony at Norway, Wisconsin, after the departure
of Bakke, whose interests he continued to look after,
and under his management a steady development followed.
This settlement became the Mecca of hundreds of immigrants
arriving in Milwaukee in the late forties, and
“Heg’s barn was for some months every summer crowded
with newcomers en route for some place farther west.”<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Another important and highly prosperous group of
settlements, called Koshkonong after the lake and creek
of that name, sprang up in 1840 and 1841, in the southwestern
corner of Jefferson County, Wisconsin, and the adjacent
parts of Dane and Rock Counties. The beginning
was made by men who removed thither from the Fox River
and Beaver Creek localities after investigating the lands
in Wisconsin. In 1840 there were nine entries of land
by Norwegians in the present townships of Albion, Christiana,
and Deerfield, the usual purchase being eighty acres;
the next few years saw the spread of the colony to the townships
of Pleasant Valley and Dunkirk, from the influx of
immigrants from Illinois and from Norway.<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> After the
stress and hardship of the first pioneer years, the fortunate
choice of location in one of the best agricultural sections
of Wisconsin told very promptly, and Koshkonong became
“the best known, richest, and most interesting Norwegian
settlement in America, the destination of thousands of
pilgrims from the fatherland since 1840.”<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Many of the
farms are still in possession of the families of the original
settlers, whose children are prominent in business, professional
and political circles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The movement of the stream of Norwegian immigrants
after 1845 was distinctly in a direction westward from the
Wisconsin settlements; the land farther out on the prairies
was better, tho it did not have the combination of timber
and stream or lake which the early settlers insisted on having,
often to their detriment, since land chosen with reference
to these requirements was apt to be marshy. The fresh
arrivals, after a few weeks or months in the friendly and
helpful communities of early immigrants, were better prepared
by a partial acclimatization, by knowledge of the
steps necessary for acquiring citizenship and land-ownership,
and by the formation of definite plans of procedure,
for the next stage in the western course of their empire.
Occasionally a shrewd farmer of the older companies took
advantage of the rise in the value of his farm, sold out,
and bought another tract farther out on the frontier, perhaps
repeating the process two or three times.<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> John
Nelson Luraas, for example, was one of those men who
first spent some time in Muskego, then bought land in
Norway, Racine County; after improving it for three years,
he sold it in 1843 and moved into Dane County.<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Here
he lived for twenty-five years, and then moved into Webster
County, Iowa, taking up new land. After a few years
he went back to his Dane County property, where he spent
another thirteen years; finally, as an aged, retired, wealthy
farmer, he died in the village of Stoughton in 1890.<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Provision for religious instruction and ministration
was one of the early concerns of the Norwegian immigrants,
as would be expected from a people essentially religious,
who moved by whole families. Nor was there much distinction
between the more orthodox and the dissenters.
After their magnetic center shifted to the west in 1835 and
the settlements and population multiplied, a good deal of
lay preaching of one sort and another went on,—Lutheran,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Methodist, Haugian, Baptist, Episcopalian, and Mormon.
Lay services, in fact, were the rule all along the westward
moving frontier, and services conducted by regular clergymen
the exception. One of the Norwegians wrote: “We
conducted our religious meetings in our own democratic
way. We appointed our leader and requested some one
to read from a book of sermons.... We prayed, exhorted,
and sang among ourselves, and even baptised our babies
ourselves.”<a id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Cut off by language from much participation in English
worship—a man must know an alien tongue long and
thoroly to make it serviceable for religious purposes—the
men from Numedal, Vos, and Drammen, felt keenly a
great need for some one to instruct their children in the
Norwegian language and in the Lutheran religion after the
Old World customs. In 1843, two hundred men and
women in the flourishing group of settlements around
Jefferson Prairie, Wisconsin, signed a petition addressed
to Bishop Sörenson in Norway asking him to send them a
capable and pious young pastor, to whom they promised
to give a parsonage, 80 acres of land, $300 in money, and
fees for baptisms, marriages, and the like.<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Tho this
petition itself seems not to have been answered, it was not
long before a properly ordained clergyman arrived.</p>

<p>Claus Lauritz Clausen, a Danish student of theology
seeking employment as a tutor in Norway, was persuaded,
probably by the father of Sören Bakke in Drammen, to
heed the call from America.<a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> On his arrival in the West
in 1843, he found the need for a pastor and preacher more
urgent than for a teacher, and accordingly he sought and
received ordination at the hands of a German Lutheran
minister, October, 1843.<a id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> He proceeded to organize, in
Heg’s barn at Norway, the first congregation of Norwegian
Lutherans in the United States, and so began a career of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>useful ministration which lasted nearly half a century. Not
long after his ordination, its validity was called in question
by strict Lutherans. The question was finally submitted to
the theological faculty of the University of Christiania,
which decided that “the circumstance that an ordination
is performed by a minister and not by a bishop, cannot in
itself destroy the validity of the ministerial ordination.”<a id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
At any rate, Clausen’s activity, general helpfulness,
staunchness of convictions, and length of service, if not his
ordination, make him one of the typical pioneer preachers.<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Another clergyman of the same class as Clausen, was
Elling Eielsen, a Haugian lay-preacher who went from
place to place in the Northwest from 1839 to 1843, holding
services with his countrymen. He was ordained in the
same month as Clausen, and, like him, in a semi-valid
fashion, by a Lutheran clergyman, not a bishop.<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Like
Clausen, also, his term of labors as a Haugian apostle,
passed forty years.<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Whatever irregularities in the ordination of Clausen
or of Eielsen may have disturbed the consciences of the
stricter of the Lutheran sect, nothing of the sort attached
to the Rev. Johannes Wilhelm Christian Dietrichson, who
arrived in 1844, fresh from the University of Christiania
and from the ordaining hands of the Bishop of Christiania.
He was a diligent, aggressive, zealous young man of about
thirty, sent out as a kind of home missionary in foreign
parts at the expense of a wealthy dyer of Christiania. For
two years, summer and winter, he went back and forth in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>southern Wisconsin ministering to the Norwegians of all
ages and beliefs,—and all for the stipend of $300 yearly.<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
One of the results of these labors, was a little book, <i>Reise
blandt de norske Emigranter i “de forenede nordamerikanske
Fristater,”</i> in which Dietrichson gives the earliest
detailed account of the settlements in Wisconsin and Illinois
before 1846. He described the origin, numbers, conditions,
and prospects of each community in his wide
parish. At Fox River, he says he found about 500, who
were of all creeds, mostly dissenters, including 150
Mormons.</p>

<p>Three church edifices were erected in 1844-5, and dedicated
within a short time of each other. Dietrichson dedicated
one at Christiana, Dane County, Wisconsin, December
19, 1844, and another at Pleasant Valley a little further
west; Clausen dedicated his church at Muskego on March
13, 1845.<a id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> All were simple structures, as would be expected;
a plain table was the altar, and the baptismal
font was hewn out of an oak log. But they served none the
less as effective and inspiring centers of the religious life
of the settlements. For the Muskego church, Even Heg
gave the land, and Mr. Bakke of Drammen, whose protégé
Clausen was, gave $400 towards construction. Dietrichson
left his two churches in Koshkonong in 1845, and returned
to Norway where he remained about a year. Aided by
benevolent friends and by the Norwegian government, he
came back to his prairie parishes in 1846 for a final stay of
four years.<a id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But his ways were not altogether ways of
pleasantness, nor entirely in the paths of peace. The records
of the church, and his own story, show that he had
more than one stormy time with his people.<a id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> He departed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>for Norway in 1850, and never again was in America.<a id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The preceding account of the beginnings and progress
of the earliest Norwegian settlements in Illinois and Wisconsin
has been given in some detail, for the reason that the
course of these settlements, in a very broad sense, is typical
of all the Norwegian colonization in the Northwest, and of
the Swedish and Danish as well. In the later chapter on
economic conditions, the causes which led these people
to settle upon the land rather than in the cities will be discussed
at length. Suffice it here to say that the average
immigrant brought only a small amount of cash, along
with his strong desire for land, and he consequently went
where good land was cheap, in order the more speedily to
get what he wanted. This meant that he would push out on
the newly accessible government land in Iowa, Minnesota,
and the Dakotas in turn. So the transformation of the
frontier has witnessed the continual repetition of the experiences
of the early Norwegian immigrants in Illinois and
Wisconsin in the years from 1835 to 1850, as they are described
in this and the preceding chapters. At the present
time, in the remoter parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Washington,
Oregon, and Utah, the same story is being retold in
the same terms of patience, hardship, thrift, and final
success.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">Swedish Immigration Before 1850.</p>


<p>When the Swedish emigration of the nineteenth century
began, it is doubtful if many persons in Sweden knew
of the existence of the descendants of their compatriots of
the seventeenth. The last Swedish pastor of Gloria Dei
Church in Philadelphia died in 1831, and there is no evidence
that any immigrant after 1800 turned his steps toward
Philadelphia or the valley of the Delaware expecting
to join the third or fourth generation of Swedes there.<a id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Before 1840, in New York, Philadelphia, and a few other
places, a Swede might now and then be found. One of these
adventure-seeking young fellows was Erick Ålund, who
reached Philadelphia in 1823; another was O. C. Lange
who arrived in Boston in 1824, and by 1838 found himself
in Chicago, probably the first of that mighty company of
Swedes which has made Chicago the third Swedish city in
the world.<a id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Olof Gustaf Hedström, who left Sweden in
1825, and his brother Jonas, were influential early arrivals.<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
But the number of such men could not have been
large, for ignorance as to America was quite as dense in
Sweden as in Norway, the name being all but unheard of
in parts of the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Sixteen years elapsed after the “Sloop Folk” landed in
New York, and five years after they located in their second
American home, in Illinois, before the Swedish immigration
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>really began. The first party, or regular company, of
Swedes, consisting of about twelve families, arrived in 1841
under the leadership of Gustav Unonius, a young man who
had been a student at the University of Upsala.<a id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It was
made up of the “better folk”, and included some, like
Baron Thott, who were entitled to be called “Herr.”<a id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The
immigration does not appear to have been induced by any
religious persecution or discontent, but was purely a business
venture of a somewhat idealistic sort, into which the
immigrants put their all, in the hope that they could get
a more satisfactory return than they could from a like
investment in Sweden.</p>

<p>From New York the party went by the water route to
Milwaukee, following in the wake of parties of Norwegians.
There they met Captain Lange, who seems to have persuaded
them to select a location near Pine Lake—a name
that would certainly attract a Swede—in the neighborhood
of the present town of Nashotah, about thirty miles west
of Milwaukee. Here they were later joined by a variegated
assortment of characters attracted by letters which Unonius
wrote to newspapers in Sweden,—noblemen, ex-army
officers, merchants, and adventurers,<a id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> so that the colony
took on almost as motley an air as that at Jamestown in
the first years after 1607. While they hardly could have
succeeded under more favorable circumstances, they were
particularly unfitted by their previous manner of living
to become farmers or to undergo the deprivations and hardships
of pioneering. The winter of 1841-2 was severe, and
their poorly-built houses gave inadequate protection
against the cold of January and February in Wisconsin;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>their land was badly tilled, tho they labored earnestly;
and their first crop fell short of their necessities. Their
hope of leading an Arcadian life in America was rudely
shattered. Captain von Schneidau, late of the staff of
King Oscar, was a farm laborer, and Baron Thott became
a cook for one of the settlers in order to get a bare living.<a id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Sickness, misfortune, want of labor, and lack of money led
to almost incredible suffering at the first, and some of the
settlers, like Unonius and von Schneidau, went to Chicago,
where the former became pastor of a Swedish congregation,
and the latter prospered as “the most skilful daguerreo-typist,
probably, in the whole state.”<a id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Frederika Bremer, the famous Swedish traveller,
visited both the Norwegian and the Swedish settlements in
Wisconsin in 1850, and has left a very graphic and sympathetic
account of the Pine Lake colony where she spent a
few days.<a id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> She found about a half dozen families of
Swedes. “Nearly all live in log-houses, and seem to be in
somewhat low circumstances. The most prosperous seemed
to be that of the smith; he, I fancy, had been a smith in
Sweden ...; he was a really good fellow, and had a nice
young Norwegian for his wife; also a Mr. Bergman who
had been a gentleman in Sweden, but who was here a clever,
hard-working peasant farmer.”<a id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> At one of the houses she
met twenty-one Swedish settlers. The failure of the colony,
to Miss Bremer’s mind, was not altogether due to circumstances;
the settlers at first “had taken with them the
Swedish inclination for hospitality and a merry life, without
sufficiently considering how long it could last. Each
family built for itself a necessary abode, and then invited
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>their neighbors to a feast. They had Christmas festivities
and Midsummer dances.”<a id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hard life of the first years at
Pine Lake, the letters from well-educated and well-known
men like Unonius, especially those published in the Swedish
newspapers, helped to stimulate a desire for emigration in
Sweden. A company of fifty, from Haurida in Smaaland,
left in the autumn of 1844, part of them going to Wisconsin,
and at least one family going to Brockton, Massachusetts,
and beginning the considerable Swedish settlement in that
city.<a id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In the following year, five families were influenced
by letters from a Pine Lake settler, to leave their homes in
Östergötland, and to set out for Wisconsin. At New York,
however, they were persuaded, probably by Pehr Dahlberg,
to go to Iowa, then just admitted to the Union, where land
was supposed to be better than at Pine Lake, and could be
had at the same price. The route followed was an unusual
one for Scandinavian immigrants,—from New York to
Pittsburg, down the Ohio River, and up the Mississippi.
The location finally chosen was in Jefferson County, Iowa,
about forty-two miles west of Burlington; and the settlement
was christened New Sweden. To it many immigrants
from the parishes of Östergötland found their way in later
years. The second rural settlement of the Swedes thus
established was, quite in contrast to the first one, distinctly
successful from the start.<a id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The first Swedish settlements in Illinois, may be
traced to the efforts of the brothers Hedström already
mentioned. Olof visited his old home in 1833, after an
absence of eight years, and on his return to New York he
was accompanied by his brother Jonas.<a id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> These two men
influenced the course which Swedish immigrants were to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>take in America down to 1854, in much the same way as
the Nattestad brothers had earlier affected the Norwegians.
After several years, spent presumably in New York, Jonas
moved into Illinois and settled in the township of Victoria,
in Knox County.<a id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Olof Hedström was converted to
Methodism in America, and became a zealous minister of
that church; in the history of Methodism in New York
City and in the chronicles of Scandinavian immigration,
his is a unique figure. The needs of the multiplying hosts
of immigrants of all sorts, who were flocking to New York,
were thoroughly understood by the Methodist authorities of
that city, and Hedström was put in charge of the North
River Mission for Seamen. His “Bethel Ship” work began
about 1845, a time when there was great need for a helping
hand to be extended to the Scandinavians, among other
immigrants, for whom agents, “runners,” and “sharks”
were lying in wait. The Rev. E. Norelius, the cultivated
and scholarly pastor and historian, who had personal experience
of the kindly offices of Hedström, declares that the
missionary was a father to the Scandinavian people who
came to America by way of New York.<a id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>With Olof Hedström offering friendly greeting, help,
and advice in New York, and working in connection with
his brother Jonas in Illinois, no prophetic instinct was
needed to foretell the goal which would be ultimately
sought by those who came under the benevolent ministrations
of this Swedish Methodist preacher. The path to
Illinois became a highway for multitudes of Swedes, and
that State was to the Swedish immigration what Wisconsin
was to the Norwegian.</p>

<p>Swedish settlement on a large scale began in 1846,
with the founding at Bishop Hill, in Henry County, Illinois,
of the famous Jansonist colony, whose history is
exceedingly interesting and, at times, highly pathetic. Not
only were there many hundreds of Swedes and some Norwegians
grouped together in a single county, but the colony
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>was also an experiment in communism, based on peculiar
religious tenets.<a id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The Jansonist movement in Sweden, which must not
be confused with the Jansenist school or system of doctrine
of another time and place in Western Europe, began about
1842 in Helsingland, in the prosperous agricultural province
of Norrland.<a id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> For fifteen years there had been an
undercurrent of dissent in the Established Church in that
province, led by Jonas Olson, who called his followers “Devotionalists.”
The agitation was carried on primarily
against the general ignorance of the people and the sloth
of the clergy, but not until Eric Janson appeared on the
scene did any organization of the dissenters take definite
form. When he moved from Wermland to Helsingland in
1844 and published the high claim that he represented the
second coming of Christ and was sent to restore the purity
and glory of Christianity, he was received with great enthusiasm
by the restless peasants, and accepted as a divinely
appointed leader who should gather the righteous into a
new theocratic community.<a id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The progress of the dissenting sect was so rapid that
the Established Church, backed by the civil authorities,
took stern measures to suppress the heresy. It must be
confessed that the dissenters continued to show a fanatical
spirit, and gave the ecclesiastical officers special cause for
alarm. In June, 1844, for example, the Jansonists made an
immense bonfire near Tranberg, and burned as useless and
dangerous, all the religious books which they could lay
their hands on, with the exception of the Bibles, hymn-books,
and catechisms. As if one offense of this kind were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>not enough to shock the pious Lutherans and everywhere
stir up the zeal of the Lutheran clergy, a second burning
of books followed in October, in which the Bible alone was
spared.<a id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Janson was repeatedly arrested and imprisoned; his
followers were subjected to the same treatment; and
finally, a price was put upon the head of the pestilent arch-heretic.
It was these persecutions, supplemented by letters
from a Swedish immigrant in America, which turned the
thoughts of the Jansonists towards the United States. So
it happened that when Janson was rescued by his friends
from the crown officer who had him in custody, he was
spirited off over the mountains to Norway, and thence to
Copenhagen, where he embarked for America. In New
York he met Olof Olson, the “advance agent,” who was
sent out by the new sect in 1845 to spy out the better country
where there was no established church, no persecution
for conscience’s sake, and no aristocracy.<a id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Olson met Olof
Hedström on landing in New York, and by him was directed
to his brother Jonas in Illinois, who gave the new-comer
a hospitable reception, and assistance in a prospecting tour
of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Olson decided on Illinois
as the State in which to plant the proposed colony. On the
arrival of Eric Janson in 1846, the exact site in Henry
County was selected, and the name Bishop Hill given it
after Biskopskulla, Janson’s birthplace in Sweden.<a id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Janson appointed leaders for the would-be emigrants,—captains
of tens and of hundreds—before he left Sweden,
and under their guidance several parties made their way
to Henry County in 1846, usually going by way of New
York, the Erie Canal, and the Great Lakes. Nearly 1100
persons were ready to emigrate, but, like the early Norwegians,
they experienced great difficulty in securing
passage, being compelled to go in companies of fifty or one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>hundred in freight vessels, usually loaded with iron.<a id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
The greater number sailed from Gefle, though some went
from Gothenburg and some from Stockholm.<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The greater part of these emigrating Jansonists were
poor peasants, unable from their own means to bear for
themselves and their families the great expense of the long
journey from Helsingland to Illinois. In addition to other
difficulties some of them had to purchase release from
military service. It was to solve these problems of poverty
and expense, that Janson followed the example of other
leaders of religious sects, even of the early Christian
leaders, and instituted community of goods for the whole
sect. The pretext seems to have been religious, but from
this distance it is clear that the motive of the leader was
essentially economic and philanthropic. Nothing could
better attest the tremendous earnestness of these uneducated
enthusiasts than their implicit obedience to the commands
of Eric Janson, for they gave all they had into his
care and discretion—their property, their families, and
themselves. The amounts contributed to the common
treasury after the sale of individual property varied
greatly, of course. Some turned in almost nothing, while
others gave sums reaching as high as 24,000 kroner, or
about $6,500.<a id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The methods and practices of the sect are revealed, in
unsympathetic and perhaps exaggerated fashion, in a
printed letter, dated at New York, May 23, 1847, written
by one who found himself unequal to the high demands of
the new faith and its self-appointed apostle.<a id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> This backslider,
who emigrated with the rest, tells a story that
sounds strangely like accounts of the action of more recent
sects and their “divinely ordained” prophets and priestesses.
Janson and all his works are denounced in very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>bitter terms. After a five-months voyage not more than
fifty out of three hundred, says the writer of the letter,
were well, and many were suffering from scurvy; but
Janson’s “prophets” came aboard and “tried to work
miracles and heal the sick,” even damning those who did
not believe they were well when they were raised up. He
further says that the Jansonists were warned in Illinois
to use medicine or the government would take a hand in
their affairs. The letter closes with a statement that more
than a hundred had already left the society.</p>

<p>The colony had a homestead at the outset, for Janson
and his co-workers purchased for $2000 a tract of 750 acres,
part of which was under cultivation. By the end of 1846,
new recruits brought the number in the settlement up to
about 400 souls, who were accommodated in log-houses,
sod-houses, dug-outs, and tents. A church was improvised
out of logs and canvas, and services were held daily
at half past five in the morning and in the evening. In
spite of the community of goods, the first year with its
crowding brought much suffering; the funds of the society
were depleted by the expenses of the great journey for so
many people, and by the expenditures for land.</p>

<p>With the coming of spring in 1847, the settlement became
a hive of industry. Adobe bricks were made, a new
saw-mill was erected, better houses were built, and more
land was bought to accommodate the new arrivals. By
1850 the community owned fourteen hundred acres of land,
nearly free from debt. The religious or economic attractiveness
of the colony is evidenced by the fact that its population
in 1851 reached the considerable figure of about
eleven hundred,<a id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> nearly one-third of the total population
of Henry County, notwithstanding a schism in 1848 whose
centrifugal force drove upwards of 200 from the fold, and
notwithstanding the epidemic of cholera in 1849 which
claimed 150 victims. Among these hundreds were representatives
of almost every province in Sweden.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>The communistic principle worked well, at least in the
first years, in spite of the severity of the religious discipline.
The land was thoroughly cultivated. The growing
of flax became a prominent factor in the prosperity of the
colony, and from this crop were made linen and carpeting
which found a ready market, the product of the looms
reaching 30,579 yards in 1851.<a id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The death of Eric Janson by the hands of a Swedish
adventurer, John Root (or Rooth), with whom he had a
quarrel of long standing, removed the prophet and builder
of this New Jerusalem, but did not seriously interrupt its
development. In fact it might be said to have been a
benefit to the colony, for Janson was not a careful and
skilful man of business, and he had involved the community
in debt. To relieve this pressure of obligation,
Jonas Olson, Janson’s right-hand man, was sent out with
eight others, in March, 1851, to seek a fortune in the California
gold fields.<a id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The period of which this chapter treats ends with
1850; but inasmuch as that year marks no break in the
history of Bishop Hill, it will be well here to finish the
sketch of the development of that colony. On learning of
the death of Janson, Olson returned at once from California
and became the head of the colony after February,
1851. Improvements immediately followed; the government,
which had been autocratic or theoretically theocratic,
became more and more democratic under Olson.
Finally, as a completion of this broadening evolution, an
act of the Illinois legislature of 1853 incorporated the
Bishop Hill Colony, and vested the government in a board
of seven trustees who were to hold for life or during good
behavior, their successors to be elected by the community.<a id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The trustees were from the first afflicted with a speculative
mania, and invested in all sorts of enterprises—in
grain, in lumber, in Galva town lots, in railroad and bank
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>stock, and in a porkpacking establishment. Disaster after
disaster followed between 1854 and 1857, when a general
panic prostrated the industries of the country. The climax
of the reckless mismanagement of the Colony came in
1860, and the corporation went into the hands of a receiver,
only to get deeper and deeper into financial and legal troubles.
Individualization of property took place in 1861,
when $592,798 was distributed among 415 shareholders,
and other property to the value of $248,861 was set aside
to pay an indebtedness of about $118,000.<a id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The last
traces of communism were gone, and with the disappearance
of communism went also the old religious tenets peculiar
to the faith. The majority of the Jansonists joined
the Methodist communion; even Jonas Olson deserted and
became “an independent Second [Seventh?] Day Adventist.”<a id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Difficulties continued, however, for Olof Johnson, the
chief offending trustee, secured his appointment as one of
the receivers. Assessment followed assessment, and when
the totals were footed up the chicanery of trustees and receivers
was made clear: to pay an original debt of $118,403,
these ill-fated people of the Bishop Hill Colony actually
expended in cash $413,124, and in property $259,786, or an
aggregate of $672,910.<a id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Of course a lawsuit was begun,
and the “Colony Case” dragged along in the courts for
twelve years, to be finally settled by compromise in 1879,
nine years after the death of Olof Johnson.<a id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Besides the numerous companies which went to Bishop
Hill, many others between 1846 and 1850 sought different
localities in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Some remained in Chicago;
some built homes in Andover, Illinois; others began
the large Swedish settlement in Jamestown, New York;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>while still others were persuaded to go to Texas, thus beginning
the only considerable permanent settlement of
Scandinavians in the Southern States before 1880, with the
exception of settlements in Missouri. During these years,
knowledge of the prosperous condition of the immigrants
was spreading, in the usual fashion, into every province of
Sweden; Småland, Helsingland, Dalarne, and Östergötland,
were especially affected. Not merely were Jansonists
and dissenters moved to emigrate, but men of the Established
Church as well; a Jansonist’s word in matters of
faith, Scriptural interpretation, and religious practice was
worse than worthless to staunch Lutherans, but there was
no reason to doubt the accuracy of his statements regarding
land, wages, prices, and opportunities in Illinois or
Iowa. Even Lutheran clergymen began to lead little companies
of their adherents to the “States,” and no one considered
it a mortal sin or eternal danger to follow in the
footsteps of worldly-wise heretics.<a id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">The Danish Immigration.</p>


<p>The Danish immigration began much later than the
Norwegian and Swedish, and its proportions were inconsiderable
until after the Civil War. Not until 1869 did
the annual influx of Danes reach 2,000. Tho the population
of Denmark was and is somewhat greater than
Norway’s, yet the Danish immigration has never in any
one year equalled the Norwegian, and in but seven years
has it been more than one-half. As against Norway’s total
of nearly 600,000 from 1820 to 1905, Denmark’s is only
about 225,000.<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In calculating the immigration, however,
a large allowance must be made. Since the duchies of
Schleswig and Holstein were acquired by Prussia in 1864
and 1866, their emigrants have of course been recorded
as German. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the movement
from Denmark has lacked momentum; its proportions are
relatively small; and the influence of the Danes in the
United States is much less important than that of either
of the other Scandinavian nationalities.</p>

<p>The causes of the smaller emigration from Denmark
are to be found in the nature of the people and in the conditions
of the kingdom itself. Generally speaking, the
Danes are not highly enterprising, adventurous, or self-confident;
instead of daring all and risking all for possible,
even probable, advantage, they remain at home, for,</p>

<p>
“Striving to better, oft we do mar what’s well.”<br />
</p>

<p>Want is practically unknown in Denmark outside the
slums of Copenhagen. The condition of the common
people has steadily improved since the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when nearly all the land was in the
hands of the nobility; at the present time, six-sevenths is
owned by the peasants. While this change has been going
on, another, of even greater significance, has taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>Improved methods of cultivation, in the course of a
hundred years, have multiplied the productive power of the
land by ten, which is equivalent to increasing tenfold the
available area of the kingdom. No nation, except the
United States and Canada, has in recent times had such
agricultural prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>As already noted, the activity of the Mormon missionaries
drew off into the wilderness of Utah nearly 2000
Danes between 1850 and 1860, and nearly 5000 more in the
next decade. In the two Prussian duchies after 1866, the
discontent of Danes who preferred emigration to German
rule drove a large number to the United States; and as
these were far from being sympathizers with Mormonism,
they found homes in the middle west. Settlements sprang
up after 1870 in Wisconsin, at Racine; in Iowa, at Elk
Horn in Shelby County and in the adjoining counties of
Audubon and Pottawatomie; and in Douglas County
(Omaha), Nebraska, just across the line from Pottawatomie
County, Iowa. It should be noted in this connection
that all the Danish settlements save those in Utah, were
well within the frontier line, and hence are not to be classed
as pioneering work, for which the Danes have shown little
inclination.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, organized at Neenah, Wisconsin, in
1872, have been several times directed deliberately to the
organization of new Danish colonies, always, of course,
with a view to strengthening the church or to carrying out
some of its peculiar ideas. Of the four colonies,—in Shelby
County, Iowa, in Lincoln County, Minnesota, in Clark
County, Wisconsin, and in Wharton County, Texas,—that
in Iowa is the most noteworthy and successful. Soon after
1880, the church secured an option on a tract of 35,000
acres in Shelby County from a land company. In return
for 320 acres to be given by the company to the church for
religious and educational purposes when one hundred
actual settlers were secured, the church promised to use
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>its influence to secure settlers for the whole tract. The
company agreed for three years time to sell only to Danes
at an average price of $7 per acre, for the first year, with
an advance not exceeding $.50 per year for each following
year. The end of the first year found more than the required
number of settlers, the church received its grant,
and still maintains its worship, a parochial school, and a
high school, in a community which numbers about 1,000
Danes. The other colonies have been less successful.<a id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The Danish element in America has always lacked
unity and solidarity. Even in their European home the
Danes possess no strong national ambition, and no national
institution claims their enthusiastic and undivided support.
The Danish church, or churches, has gripped its
immigrant sons and daughters less closely than similar
organizations among the Swedes and Norwegians. It is
estimated that only one out of fifteen of the Danes in the
United States belongs to some church, while one out of
five of the Swedes, one out of three and one-half of the
Norwegians, and one out of three of the total population
of the country, is connected with an ecclesiastical organization.<a id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>One reason for the low ebb of church influence among
the Danes is undoubtedly the wranglings of the clergy
over matters of theology and polity, a continuation of the
factional differences between the followers of Bishop
Grundtvig and the anti-Grundtvigians or Inner Mission
people in the years 1854-1895. In its beginning, the
Danish Lutheran Church in America unanimously adopted
this resolution: “We, the Danish ministers and congregations,
hereby declare ourselves to be a branch of the Danish
National Church, a missionary department established by
that church in America.”<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The government of Denmark
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>recognized this relation; graduates of the University of
Copenhagen, who received calls to churches in America,
were ordained by a bishop in Denmark, and were appointed
by the King as regular ministers in the Danish Church;
and since 1884 the Danish Government has made a small
annual appropriation for the education of ministers for the
American branch of the Danish Church. This allowance
was at first spent in Denmark, but since 1887, in the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But with all this effort at maintaining
unity and continuity, the American branch has not been
united, peaceable or effective.</p>

<p>If the test of supporting educational institutions for
their own people be applied to the Danes, the same deficiency
of interest and contributions as in matters ecclesiastical,
will be revealed. The attempt of the Grundtvigians
to set up the peculiar “high schools” which they
maintained in Denmark, for instruction of the common
people in Scandinavian history, mythology, religion,
language, and literature, all in Danish, was doomed to
failure.<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The first of these schools was located at Elk
Horn, Iowa, in the midst of the largest Danish settlement
in the United States, yet in the fifteen years after its
establishment in 1878 the average attendance never reached
forty. Four other schools, in Ashland, Michigan, in Nysted,
Nebraska, in Polk County, Wisconsin, and in Lincoln
County, Minnesota, all established between 1878 and 1888,
suffered from like indifference and lack of financial help;
not one averaged thirty pupils per year. Aside from
tuition, the contributions of the Danes for educational
purposes did not reach fifty cents per communicant during
any consecutive five years up to 1894.<a id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> This is a poor
showing alongside the three dollars per communicant contributed
by the Norwegians when they were building
Decorah College in 1861 to 1865.<a id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">A Half Century of Expansion and Distribution,
1850-1900.</p>


<p>While the immigration movement from Norway and
Sweden was well-established by 1850, and certain to expand,
it was numerically unimportant when compared
with that from some other countries of Europe. In 1849
the influx from all Scandinavia was slightly more than one
per-cent of the total immigration from Europe. Yet the
rising stream had, by 1850, worn for itself a clear and
definite channel from eastern ports like New York and
Boston to such gateways to the Northwest as Chicago and
Milwaukee; and through these it continued to flow out over
the wilderness of the upper Mississippi Valley extending
north of the Missouri and Illinois Rivers and west of the
Great Lakes. For more than a half century there have
been relatively few variations from this course, tho in
the later decades, with an increase in the proportion of
skilled laborers among the incoming thousands, certain
eastern cities have detained a considerable percentage.</p>

<p>No other marked change in the character and quality
of the immigrants has developed since 1850, nor have any
new motives appeared, except in the case of the Danes, to
be discussed later. In a word, the Scandinavian immigration
since 1850 is simply the earlier Scandinavian immigration
enlarged in numbers, with broader and deeper significance.
The areas of interest in emigration in Europe
gradually extended to every part and every class of the
three Northern kingdoms; and the localities attractive to
Scandinavians in the United States, expanded until eight
contiguous States in the Old Northwest and the Newer
Northwest showed each a foreign-born population of
Northmen numbering more than thirty thousand. In the
State of Minnesota they now reach close to a quarter of a
million.<a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>The total recorded Scandinavian immigration, according
to the statistics of the United States, from 1820 to
1912, is in round numbers 2,200,000. According to the
statistics of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which may be
disregarded for inaccuracy before 1850, the total falls
about 142,000 short of this figure, a difference which may
be easily enough accounted for by persons leaving those
countries for a more or less indefinite stay in other parts
of Europe, before starting for America.<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The American
statistics in later years have sometimes shown larger numbers
than the Swedish, but the discrepancy is accounted
for by the fact that a great number of emigrants from Finland
have passed through Sweden on their way to America
and therefore are counted as Swedes.<a id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The totals by decades
with the percentages of the whole immigration for
the decades, is as follows:<a id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The fluctuations of the annual immigration have been
very great, as an inspection of the accompanying chart
and the tables in Appendix I, will readily show. The
addition of other lines to this chart indicating the fluctuations
in the numbers of immigrants from Germany and
Ireland, demonstrates that these rather striking variations
were chiefly caused by conditions and prospects in America,
rather than by circumstances in Europe. In 1849 the
total immigration of Norwegians and Swedes passed 2,000,
and even reached 3,400, but the terrible scourge of cholera
in that year under which so many of the Scandinavians
in the West fell, caused a falling off of more than half in
1850. After the panic of 1857, the Danish immigration
fell from 1,035 to 252 in one year, while the total from the
Northern lands fell steadily from 2,747 to 840 in 1860.</p>

<p>The Civil War disturbed comparatively little the conditions
favoring Scandinavian immigration, for the Northwest
was never in danger of invasion, and nominal prices
for farm produce ranged higher and higher. Furthermore,
the Homestead Act of 1862 gave new and cumulative impetus
to the immigration which sought farming lands.<a id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
So from a total of 850 in 1861 (the statistics of Norway
show 8,900 emigrants for that year, and those of Sweden,
1,087), the numbers gradually increased, in spite of the
war, to 7,258 in 1865. The panic of 1873 did not affect the
Scandinavian movement so immediately and seriously as
might at first thought be expected, probably because the
Northmen were seeking farms in the West, and also because
the farmers as a class are about the last to feel the
effects of financial crises like that of 1873. As the depression
deepened, letters from America to Northern Europe
lost their tone of buoyancy and enthusiasm; the eastward
flow of passage-money and prepaid tickets almost ceased.
At the same time a series of good crops in the three Scandinavian
countries caused a rise of wages about 1873, doubling
them in some instances.<a id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Consequently the current
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>of immigration lost force and volume for several years, the
totals dropping, in round numbers, from 35,000 in 1873, to
19,000 in 1874, and to 11,000 in 1877.</p>

<p>After the high-water mark of 105,326 in 1882, reached
during the revival of business from 1879 to 1884, the totals
did not again fall below 40,000 Scandinavian immigrants
per year, until after the industrial and financial stagnation
of 1893 to 1896; 62,000 in 1893 became 33,000 in 1894, and
19,000 in 1898. With the prosperity of the first years of the
new century in the United States, the number again passed
50,000, reaching another climax in the 77,000 of 1903.</p>

<p>In general, the variations of the curves for the three
nationalities under discussion have been nearly co-incident,
as for example the high points in 1873 and 1882, and the
low points in 1877, 1885, and 1898. The Danish immigration
did not rise proportionately with the other two, especially
in 1903, probably because of the democratizing of
land-ownership in Denmark, and because of the remarkable
improvement in methods of cultivation in the course of the
nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> No such decided improvements took
place in the other peninsular kingdoms.</p>

<p>Another feature of the fluctuation is entitled to some
consideration. In proportion to the population of those
nations, the emigration from Norway and Sweden since
1870 has been very large, and such drafts as were made in
the years 1882 or 1903 could not be expected to keep up.
The periodicity of the ripening of a good “crop” of eligible
emigrants for the great American West seems to have been
since 1877 from five to eight years. In this connection it
is a noteworthy fact that the population in each of the
Scandinavian kingdoms, notwithstanding the great emigrations,
has steadily tho slowly increased since 1850.<a id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> For
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>the last decade of the nineteenth century, the figures
for the increase were, Denmark, 16.6%, Norway, 10.6%,
Sweden 7.3%, United States 20%.<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In this statistical distribution,
account must also be taken of the Scandinavians
of the second generation, born in this country of foreign-born
parents, since this element, racially speaking, is just
as much an alien stock, with its inheritance of tendencies,
temperament, and passions, as were the original immigrants.

<p>To these must be added still another group, made up of
those persons having a father born in Norway, Sweden, or
Denmark, and a mother born in one of the other two
countries, in other words, persons of pure Scandinavian
descent. The number of such in 1910 was 72,152. It does
not include, be it noted, those persons of equally pure
Norse blood whose parents, one or both, were born in the
United States. The minimum number of Scandinavians,
then, in the United States in 1910, who must be taken into
account in all calculations and estimates of power and
influence exercised by that factor of the population, is
2,428,201. If it were desired to bring the estimate up
to date, the immigration of 1910-1913 and an approximation
of the increase of the native-born, would have to be included,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>and the grand total of persons of pure Northern
stock would not be far from 2,700,000 at the present
time (1913).</p>

<p>The distribution of this vast company to the different
States of the Union is a consideration of primary importance.
The detailed analysis of the motives, processes, and
results of the occupation of the Northwestern States by the
children of the Northlands, belongs in later chapters.<a id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
The reasons why the stream flowed to the north of Mason
and Dixon’s Line are a combination of climate and a fear
and hatred of slavery. If the movement from Scandinavia
had begun fifty years earlier, before the anti-slavery agitation
became acute, the New Norway and the New Sweden
of the nineteenth century, would doubtless still have been
in the North and probably in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan,
for very much the same reason that the Western Reserve
was a New Connecticut.</p>

<p>Desiring ownership of good agricultural land above
all else, and finding after 1835 that the best and cheapest
was to be found along the advancing frontier west of a
north-and-south line drawn through Chicago, the men
from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark followed their distant
cousins of New England and the Middle States in the
great trek into the Any-Man’s-Land of the fertile upper
Mississippi Valley.<a id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> For more than two decades after
the Civil War, tho slavery no longer existed in the
South, that region was still in the depression and uncertainty
of the post-bellum industrial disorganization, and
hence unattractive to immigrants of any class. So the tide
continued to run high in the Northwest and spread wider
and wider because of the traditions of two generations, and
because of the attracting power of the Scandinavian mass
already comfortably and solidly settled there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>The first States of the Northwest into which the Norwegians
and Swedes penetrated, as has been described
above, were Illinois and Wisconsin; and in the censuses
of 1850 and 1860 Wisconsin held first place in the number
of these aliens, showing an increase from 8,885 to 23,265.<a id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
In 1850, Iowa, in the “far west,” ranked fourth, with 611.
Minnesota, which then stretched away to the Rocky Mountains,
had 4 Swedes, 7 Norwegians, and 1 Dane.<a id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> By 1860
Iowa was passed by Minnesota which then had 11,773, and
thenceforward the Scandinavians were to keep close step
with the westward march of the frontier. In 1870 Minnesota
took first place, with 58,837, a position which the
State has continued to hold. In 1890 she had within her
borders 236,670 foreign-born Northmen, and enough of
the second generation to make her Scandinavian population
466,365, or about one-fifth that of Denmark or Norway.
The order of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa held
good for 1870 and 1880, but Wisconsin and Illinois changed
places in the reports of 1890 and 1900. The Dakotas, as one
Territory, received their first Norse settler in 1858, but
when the census of 1880 was taken there were 17,869, and
in 1890, when the Territory was divided into two States,
the Scandinavian contingent was more than 65,000 strong.<a id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
Nebraska illustrated in a similar manner the widening
overflow of the steady stream out of the European North;
her population of Scandinavian birth which numbered only
3,987 in 1870, grew by direct entry of immigrants, and by
the secondary movement of early immigrants out of the
middle Northwest, to 16,685 in 1880, and to 40,107 of foreign-born
in 1900. According to this last census, Nebraska
counted 38,914 native persons of foreign-born Scandinavian
parents, showing that the second generation did not fall
much behind the first in the habit of frontier-seeking.<a id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>In the rush of gold-seekers into California after 1848
were many Danes and Swedes, who gave that State in 1860
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>fifth rank as to the number of Scandinavians; by 1890
these numbered about 42,000, of whom the greater part
were of the two nationalities just named. Another frontier
region which gained from the Danish immigration between
1850 and 1860 was the Territory of Utah, for the Mormon
missionaries seem to have been particularly successful in
Denmark, and nearly every convert became an immigrant.
Quite in advance of their invasion of Dakota, more than
2,000 Danes had settled in the Mormon Territory, and ten
years later Utah counted nearly twice as many Scandinavians
as Nebraska, seven-tenths being Danes.</p>

<p>The increasing density of this Scandinavian population
in certain localities,—what might be called its vertical
distribution—is strikingly illustrated in both urban and
rural communities. Chicago had barely emerged from the
Fort Dearborn stage when the first Scandinavians walked
its streets. Yet within two generations there were found
inside of her wide-stretching borders more than 100,000
Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes of foreign birth, and
enough of the second generation to give her more than 190,000,
so that the city at the head of Lake Michigan was next
after Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Christiania,—the largest
Scandinavian city in the world.<a id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> By a similar calculation,
Minneapolis would rank sixth or seventh.</p>

<p>Rockford, Illinois, received the first of its signally
prosperous Swedish colony about 1853; by 1865 the city
had 2,000 Swedes.<a id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The census of 1910 credits Rockford
with 10,000 foreign born Swedes, and a total of Swedish
parentage reaching close to 19,000. One of the west-central
counties of Minnesota, Otter Tail, counted (1900) more
than half of its 45,000 population of pure Scandinavian
blood of the first and second generation of immigrants. Polk
county, newer and farther north in the same State, reveals
almost sixty per-cent of the same sort of population in a
total of 35,000. For some of the still newer and more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>sparsely settled counties even larger percentages might be
obtained.</p>

<p>A closer analysis of the tables of population reveals
some further facts as to the distribution of the different
nationalities. The Swedes are the most numerous in Minnesota,
Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, and Kansas;
the Norwegians predominate in Wisconsin, North Dakota,
and South Dakota, and nearly equal the Swedes in Minnesota
where each passes 200,000. The Danes are strongest—they
can hardly be called a very important factor in any
State—in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Nebraska;
in each State they have more than 25,000. Another
feature of this varying density of the three groups has to do
with the cities. Chicago, Rockford, Minneapolis, St. Paul,
and Duluth account for a large proportion of the Swedes
of Illinois and Minnesota, and represent the later rather
than the earlier stages of distribution. Outside of the
cities mentioned, the Norwegians in Minnesota outnumber
the Swedes by some 52,000. In North Dakota, the Norwegians
are 72% of the foreign-born Scandinavian population,
in South Dakota, 56%, and in Wisconsin, 60%,
while in Illinois the Swedes are about 70%, and in Michigan
and Nebraska, 63% and 59% respectively. The Danes
reach their highest percentages of the Scandinavian foreign-born
in Utah, 50%, in Nebraska, 34%, and in Iowa,
23%. Large numbers of the later immigrants, especially
of the skilled Swedish laborers, have found occupation in
New York and Brooklyn, Boston and Worcester, Hartford
and Providence. These have raised the proportion of the
Swedes in the United States living in cities of more than
25,000, to 36%, while only 28% of the Danes, and 19% of
the Norwegians were similarly located in 1900.<a id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Climate, particularly the mean temperature, has also
played considerable part in the choice by the immigrants
from Northern Europe of the sites for their new homes,
though it is an open question whether they would not have
been established where they were and when they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>even if the climate were different. Certain it is that the
few Icelandic settlements are situated in the extreme
northern part of Minnesota and North Dakota, and in
Southern Manitoba.<a id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> South of them come, in order, the
zones of densest Norwegian population, 49° to 42°, of the
Swedish, 48° to 40°, and of Danish, 44° to 38°. The three
nationalities thus occupy relatively the same latitudinal
position in America as in their homes in the Old North.<a id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Summarizing the matter of location, the great bulk
of the Scandinavian immigrants went into the Northwest,
78% of them during the first fifty years of the movement,
and about 70% of the total. Out of the immigration of the
different nationalities, 81% of the Norwegians are in the
Northwest, 60% of the Danes, and 59% of the Swedes, the
percentage of the last being brought down, in comparison
with the Norwegians, by the fact that nearly 100,000
Swedes are found in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania.<a id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The Civil War occurred before the numbers and expansion
of the Norse element of the country’s population
had much passed a promising beginning; the 75,000 present
in 1860 could not be expected to play any large and leading
rôle. Yet the one dramatic and heroic chapter in the whole
story of the progress of the Scandinavians in America is
that dealing with their part in that great struggle, in which
many hundreds of them gave their strength and their lives
for the unity and safety of their adopted country no less
bravely and no less cheerfully than did the native-born
American. The men from Thelemark and Smaaland and the
sons of Massachusetts and Michigan were inspired by the
same fine and pure motives; they hated slavery and loved
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the flag under whose folds they realized their hopes and
dreams.<a id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> By temperament, by religion, by education, by
tradition, men of Norse parentage were fitted to participate
in upholding a cause so essentially right and high.</p>

<p>In the short space of this volume, details of the loyal
services of companies made up wholly or in large part of
Swedes and Norwegians must be omitted, and the laurels
won by such men as General Stohlbrand, who was made
a brigadier by President Lincoln himself,<a id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Colonel H. C.
Heg,<a id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Colonel Mattson,<a id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and Lieutenant Colonel Porter
C. Olson,<a id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> must be passed by with mere allusions.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Wisconsin Regiment of Volunteers, consisting
of about 900 men, whose organization was decided
upon at a mass meeting held in the Capitol at Madison, in
September, 1861, was made up almost entirely of Norwegians
and Swedes, some of whom had been in the United
States less than a year. Hans C. Heg, one of the early
leaders of the Norwegian immigration into Wisconsin, was
appointed colonel of the regiment and began organization
at Camp Randall, near Madison, in the following December.<a id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
The roster of officers indicates plainly their origin,
including such names as Rev. C. L. Clausen, Thorkildson,
Hansen, Grinager, Skofstad, Ingmundson, Tjentland, and
Solberg.<a id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The regiment left for the front in March, 1862,
and participated in the operations of the next three years
in Kentucky, Tennessee and northern Georgia. It was
mustered out at Chattanooga in February, 1865, having
lost about 300, quite one-third of its total enlistment, from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>deaths in battle or in the hospitals, including Colonel
Heg, who was killed at Chickamauga.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Its record is
summed up by the military historian of Wisconsin who
states that it was “one of the bravest and most efficient
regiments that Wisconsin sent to the field.”<a id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Besides this Scandinavian regiment, there were several
others in which the Norse element was large. Company
C of the 43d Illinois Regiment was made up of
Swedes, serving under Captain Arosenius. It was organized
in the spring of 1862 and mustered out in the fall of
1865, with an honorable record of services faithfully and
uncomplainingly performed.<a id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Company D of the 57th
Illinois Regiment, which served from the autumn of 1861
to July, 1864,<a id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and Company D of the 3d Minnesota Regiment,
which was mustered in at about the same time,<a id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
were composed of Scandinavians. A sprinkling of Swedes,
Norwegians, and Danes appears in the lists of many of the
regiments of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and many
of these men rose to the ranks of commissioned officers.<a id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
The Adjutant General of Minnesota in 1866 estimated that
of the enlistments from that State, at least 800 were Norwegians,
675 Swedes, and 25 Danes. “In numerous instances
the nativity of the soldiers is omitted; and it is
not easy to count correctly all the names in such publications;
hence it is fair to estimate that 2,000 Scandinavians
from Minnesota enlisted under the Stars and
Stripes.... One-eighth of the total population of the
State enlisted under the Union flag; while at the same
time one out of every six Scandinavians in Minnesota, as
well as in Wisconsin, fought for his adopted country.”<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Everywhere the story of their services in the army is
creditable, and it is not strange that the survivors are
proud of their war records as the badge of loyal Americanism.
They did not go into the war for mere love of
adventure, nor for love of fighting, for men in large numbers
do not leave their families and their half-developed
farms for flimsy and temporary reasons. They loved the
new country they had made their own, with a love that was
measurable in the high terms of sacrifice, even to the shedding
of blood and to death. The stock out of which Gustavus
Adolphus made brave and effective soldiers had not
degenerated through lapse of time nor through transplanting.</p>

<p>Though John Ericsson was in no wise connected with
the regular Swedish immigration movement, nor with
Swedish settlement in the Northwest, the United States
owes him too large a debt for what has sometimes been
called the salvation of the Union through the agency of
his “Monitor”, to warrant the omission of his name from
among those Swedes who served American freedom during
the Civil War.<a id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">Economic Forces at Work.</p>


<p>In the many monographs and more pretentious works
dealing with various phases of the economic history of the
United States, much attention has been given to the tariff,
manufacturing, banking, currency, transportation, and
public lands. Only recently have the economic results of
immigration begun to receive the attention which their
importance deserves. For a long time the excellent work
of Professor Richmond Mayo-Smith, <i>Emigration and Immigration</i>
(1890), notable for the strength and breadth of its
general treatment, was quite alone in its field. Mere statistical
studies no longer suffice, and just as the census-taking
of the Federal Government has changed from the
simple, old-fashioned inventory of numbers—so many
heads, black and white, native-born and foreign-born—to
an elaborate investigation of the life problem of the population,
so the meaning of immigration as a whole, and of
Scandinavian immigration in particular, requires a discussion
extending beyond annual and decennial statistics
and maps of the density of settlement.</p>

<p>In the economic development of the Northwest, as compared
with the history of the Eastern, Middle, or Southern
States during the nineteenth century, the three principal
topics are immigration, the Federal land policy, and improvements
in transportation. In a peculiar manner the
last two subjects are interwoven with the story of the Norwegians,
Swedes, and Danes in America. When people by
the hundreds of thousands were settled in the West, when
commerce and manufacturing arose upon the sound basis
of a prospering agriculture, then and not till then, protection,
currency, and bimetallism might be accepted as real
and immediate issues.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian immigrants along the frontiers, like
the other pioneers all through the prairie west, were from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the first vitally interested in securing some form of cheap
transportation of the produce of the farms to a good market;
railroads were indispensable to the development of the
agricultural areas of the Great West. Western Pennsylvania
might find profit in 1794 in shipping the quintessence
of its agriculture across the mountains in demijohns; the
cattlemen of the South and Southwest might drive their
products to market on the hoof; but at the very best these
were exceptional, inelastic, and primitive methods. Many
pioneer Norwegians and Swedes in Minnesota and Iowa
were obliged to carry their wheat and corn forty and fifty
miles to have it ground for their families, but they could
not hope to haul any great amount of ordinary farm produce
over the abominable roads of the West for a distance
greater than forty miles and make a profit.<a id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Without the
hope of railroads, the vast stretches of cereal-producing
land in the trans-Mississippi would long have remained
virgin soil. Yet without assurance that population would
rapidly increase in numbers and in complexity of life, thus
giving a large traffic in both directions, no railroad company
would build out into the thinly settled area.<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Broadly speaking, then, the real problem of the Northwestern
frontier after 1850 was: how to put more and ever
more men of capacity, endurance, strength, and adaptability
into the upper Mississippi and Red River valleys,
men who first break up the prairie sod, clear the brush off
the slopes, drain the marshes, build the railroads, and do
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>the thousands and one hard jobs incident to pioneer life,
and then turn to the building of factories and towns and
cities. Not every sort of man who could hold a plow or
wield a hoe would do: Chinese coolies, for example, would
hardly be considered desirable, even with all their capacity
for hard work, persistence, and patience. Furthermore, it
is plain now, that the West could not have looked to the
Eastern States alone to send out an industrial army sufficient
in numbers and spirit for the conquest of the new
empire and the extraction of its varied resources at the
desired speed. The demands were too severe, the rewards
too remote and uncertain for the average prosperous
native-born citizen. The aliens from the western side of
the Atlantic, as it were by regiments and battalions, must
re-enforce the companies westward-bound from the older
States; in such a situation the Scandinavians were all but
indispensable to rapid material progress in the Northwest
after the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>It is not easy to realize how attractive to the Northland
immigrants were the broad, level lands of the West,
to be had from the United States Government on the easiest
of terms, both before and after the passage of the Homestead
Act of 1862. Scarcely in their dreams had they conceived
of soil so fertile, so readily tilled, and so cheaply
acquired. To speak to a Norwegian from Thelemarken, to
a Swede from Smaaland, or to a Dane from the misty,
sandy coast of Jutland, about rich, rolling prairies stretching
away miles upon miles, about land which was neither
rocky, nor swampy, nor pure sand, nor set up at an angle
of forty-five degrees, about land which could be had almost
for the asking in fee simple and not by some semi-manorial
title—this was to speak to his imagination rather than to
his understanding. The letters from immigrants to their old
friends in Europe continually dilated on these advantages,
sometime with a curious mingling of humor and pathos.
One of these communications, which was printed as a small
pamphlet in 1850, sets forth in large letters, that the land
was so plentiful that the pigs and cattle were allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
run at will.<a id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> What more could be asked of Providence by
a poor peasant or “husmand,” owing to his landlord, for
the little strip of land on which he lived, the labor of two or
three days each week?<a id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>These strictly economic advantages of soil and price
were not the only attractions for the sons of the Northlands.
Both the traveller and the prospector for a site for a settlement
were deeply impressed by the general appearance of
the rolling country of the Northwest with its abundance of
streams and lakes. During her visit to Wisconsin and
Minnesota in the fall of 1850, Frederika Bremer saw with
quite prophetic vision, the possibilities of the region:</p>

<p>“What a glorious new Scandinavia might not Minnesota
become! Here would the Swede find again his clear,
romantic lakes, the plains of Scania rich in corn, and the
valleys of Norrland; here would the Norwegian find his
rapid rivers, his lofty mountains, for I include the Rocky
Mountains and Oregon, in the new kingdom; and both nations
their hunting fields and their fisheries. The Danes
might here pasture their flocks and herds, and lay out their
farms on richer and less misty coasts than those of
Denmark.... Scandinavians who are well off in the old
country ought not to leave it. But such as are too much
contracted at home, and who desire to emigrate, should
come to Minnesota. The climate, the situation, the character
of the scenery, agrees with our people better than
that of any other of the American States, and none of them
appear to me to have a greater or a more beautiful future
before them than Minnesota. Add to this that the rich soil
of Minnesota is not yet bought up by speculators, but may
everywhere be purchased at government prices.... There
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>are here already a considerable number of Norwegians and
Danes.”<a id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The Swedish air-castle took material shape
rapidly; during forty years the name Minnesota, even
more than Iowa, or Wisconsin, was a name to conjure
with among the laborers and would-be farmers of the old
kingdoms.<a id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Of the peculiar fitness of the Swedes, Norwegians, and
Danes for this promotion of economic progress in a great
section of the country, there is practically a unanimous
opinion. A dispassionate, mature estimate is expressed
officially by an agent of the British Government sent out
to study the question of immigration in the United States.
“It is generally admitted,” he states, “that physically,
morally, and socially, no better class of immigrants enter
the United States. In some respects they are the most
desirable of all.”<a id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> A first-hand observer of their work as
western farmers wrote in 1868 concerning the settlers in
a Norwegian township in Minnesota, “They open their
farms quicker, raise better stock than most any other class,
and quickly become wealthy.”<a id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> In a hearing before the
Industrial Commission in 1899, Hermann Stump, a prominent
German, testified that the Scandinavians “are really
the best immigrants who come to the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>While the Scandinavians were admirably fitted to
become substantial citizens and to develop their own
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>properties, and while the prospect of possessing a farm
was the most potent and pervading influence affecting their
movements after about 1850, the very high rate of wages
paid in the United States, as compared with the wages in
Europe, was everywhere an important factor among the
immediate attractions. All of the western States, in the
first decade of their growth, were exceedingly anxious to
secure settlers who should take up and improve the vacant
square miles, thus adding to the population and to the
taxable values of the commonwealth. At the same time
there was a large and steady demand for wage-labor; the
farmers needed helpers; the construction of internal improvements,
begun and projected, like the rapidly expanding
railroad systems, could be carried on only by the aid
of an abundance of laborers.<a id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>These needs could not be met by any considerable
migration of laborers from the eastern States, for there
the development of manufacturing and of transportation
by land and by sea would operate to keep up wages and so
to hold the laborers. The hard labor of the Far West,
therefore, must be done, if done at all, by those who had not
already found places for themselves in the industrial system
of the United States, and for such services a good rate of
wages would be paid, or at least a rate sufficient to draw
the desired labor. In 1851 the $15 per month received by
some Swedes working as farm hands near Buffalo, New
York, was considered “big wages.”<a id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> At
the same time laborers on railroad construction in the West were receiving
$.75 and $1 per day. Whether measured as real or nominal
wages, these rates were certainly higher than even the
average skilled laborer could earn in Norway or Sweden.<a id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>Tho
the wages in the peninsular kingdoms rose considerably from 1850 to 1875,
there was still at the later date and afterwards a large differential in
favor of the American scale, whether for skilled or unskilled laborers. The
experienced agricultural laborer in the fields of Illinois
or Wisconsin received two or three times as much as the
corresponding worker in Norway and Sweden, while in
new States like Minnesota the multiple was even greater.<a id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
Still more marked were the differences between skilled
laborers, such as carpenters and smiths, in America and
Europe even after the panic of 1873.<a id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The eloquence of these figures, and of the conditions
behind them, was not left to do its work by chance in the
private letters of immigrants or in the occasional pamphlet.
States and counties, as well as railroad corporations disseminated
very widely and systematically the knowledge
of the opportunities open to the laborer in the great West.
If he were a man who would progress from a temporary
tho necessary factor in construction or in the field, to a
permanent settler taking up vacant land, so much the
better for the State and the corporation. Fortunately for
those great railroads, which were pushing construction and
receiving large subsidies in public lands, they found just
such men in the Swedes and Norwegians. As the Rock
Island railroad pushed across Illinois and Iowa, as the
Northern Pacific built out through Minnesota and Dakota,
and as the road now known as the Great Northern carried
its lines from St. Paul into the Red River valley, and on
across North Dakota, the Scandinavian and the Irishman
supplied the demand for labor front 1850 to 1890, in precisely
the same way as the Italian, Pole, Mexican and
Greek have been doing in later years.</p>

<p>When construction of a railroad ended, the demand
for immigrants merely changed its form and became cumulative.
The dividends of any railroad running out into a
new country depend on the development of the tributary
territory, and this is especially true of the land-grant roads
which owned half of the land within ten miles of their
tracks. Thus it came about that the Scandinavians were
doubly valuable, first as laborers for wages, and second as
independent farmers in the townships made accessible by
the new lines.<a id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> It was, indeed, faith in human nature, and
especially Swedish and Norwegian human nature, which
led to the construction and profitable operation of hundreds
of miles of new roads in Minnesota and Dakota after 1880.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>One prominent railroad man estimated that each settler
(presumably each head of a family) meant in the long run
from $200 to $300 a year for the railroad.<a id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>The fulfilment of the expectations of the builders of
railroads and commonwealths was often surprisingly
prompt. The prophetic insight of at least one “captain of
industry,” President James J. Hill of the Great Northern
Railway Company which built its transcontinental system
without land-grant, was as sure a reliance for capital as
the subsidy of the federal Government. Speaking in 1902
at Crookston, in the center of the great Scandinavian
region in northwestern Minnesota, he described in striking
terms the growth of farm values, and of the railroad business
in some of the towns in Minnesota and North Dakota:
“I took the best towns [of the Red River valley] outside
Crookston [for comparison with towns in North Dakota]....
I will give you the annual business. Warren’s
last year’s railroad business with our company was $86,000;
Hallock, $94,000,—a respectable sum; Stephen,
$87,000; Ada, $81,000.... Langdon [in North Dakota] ...
away up towards the boundary, upon Pembina
Mountain, $210,000; Osnabrock, I hardly know where it
is myself, $101,000; Park River, $170,000; ... Bottineau,
away at the west end of the Turtle Mountains, where a few
years ago people said it was too far away; could not live
there and could not raise anything if they did live there,
$258,000.... Land up there [around Bottineau], worth
$3, $5, and $8 an acre, and a few pieces $10 an acre, a few
years ago, is worth today $25 and $30 per acre.”<a id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The railroads left nothing undone to stimulate the
economic desire of the Scandinavians to migrate to their
particular sections of land and to the adjoining government
sections. Several companies maintained for years regular
immigration or land agents, besides a considerable and
variable corps of sub-agents, port agents, and lecturers;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>some of them paid the expenses of men representing groups
of prospective immigrants, who desired to visit and report
upon a particular locality. The St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp;
Manitoba Railroad advertised in “Facts about Minnesota”
(1881): “The settler—his family, household goods, live
stock and agricultural implements—will be carried from
St. Paul to any point on either of our lines at one-half
the regular price.”</p>

<p>Besides these efforts and inducements, the railroad
companies prepared handbooks in different languages, distributed
them widely throughout the East and West, and
circulated them systematically in Norway, Sweden and
Denmark.<a id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> A few of the companies even sent special
representatives to Europe to work directly with the people
of those countries. The Hon. Hans Mattson left the office
of Secretary of State in Minnesota in 1871 to become the
liberally paid European agent for the Northern Pacific
Railroad whose resources he was to advertise from his
headquarters in Sweden.<a id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> He was not, however, to organize
regular parties of emigrants. A high official of one of
the northwestern roads summed up the matter by saying,
“There is as much competition among the railroads desiring
to attract immigrants, as among dry-goods stores in
aiming to attract customers.”</p>

<p>The northwestern State governments were hardly less
interested in inducing immigrants to help fill up the vacant
square miles and townships than were the railroads, for
developed farms meant towns, diversified industry, and
greater assessment values, which, being translated, meant
much-needed public buildings, institutions, and improvements.
The competition of the States, for immigrants such
as the Norwegians, re-enforced and parallelled that of the
railroad and land companies. Wisconsin appointed a Commissioner
of Emigration in 1852, who resided in New York,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>and employed a Norwegian and a German assistant.<a id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The
following year another Act created a Traveling Emigrant
Agent, and prescribed that he should “travel constantly
between this State and the city of New York,” to advertise
“our great natural resources, advantages and privileges,
and brilliant prospects for the future.”<a id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Pamphlets by
the thousand in German, Norwegian, and Dutch were sent
out in America and Europe. The office was abolished in
1855, but in 1867 another Act created an unpaid Board of
Immigration and appropriated $2,000 for printing pamphlets
in English, Welsh, German, and the Scandinavian
languages.<a id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The State even went so far, in a later Act,
as to authorize the Board, in its discretion, to help with
money, “such immigrants as are determined to make Wisconsin
their future home.”<a id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The Board was succeeded by a Commissioner (Ole C.
Johnson) in 1871, whose office was in turn abolished in
1874. The story of Wisconsin’s later organizations for
promoting immigration ought almost to go into the chapter
on politics—a new Board in 1879, abolished in 1887, renewed
for two years in 1895, and revived for another two
years in 1899.<a id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> In 1880, at the request of the president of
the Wisconsin Central Railway Company, K. K. Kennan,
agent of the land department of that company, was also
appointed agent for the State in Europe, without expense
to the State.<a id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>For the same purposes, and with the same methods,
Iowa had a Commissioner, 1860-1862, and a Board (of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>which the Rev. C. L. Clausen was a member), 1870-1874,
which sent agents to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, where
they published articles in the newspapers and stirred up
emigration sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Minnesota, likewise, in 1867 created a Board of Emigration,
and Hans Mattson was appointed secretary. He
proved a very efficient officer, and not the less so because
at the same time, as he admits, he acted as land agent for
one of the great railroad companies, whose line went
through Wright, Meeker, Kandiyohi, Swift and Stevens
counties.<a id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Of the work of the Board, Mattson gives a
convincing summary: “In the above-named localities there
were only a few widely scattered families when I went
there in 1867, while it is now (1891) one continuous Scandinavian
settlement, extending over a territory more than
a hundred miles long and dotted over with cities and towns,
largely the result of the work of the board of emigration
during the years 1867, 1868, and 1869.... Our efforts,
however, in behalf of Minnesota brought on a great deal
of envy and ill-will from people in other States who were
interested in seeing the Scandinavian emigration turned
towards Kansas and other States, and this feeling went so
far that a prominent newspaper writer in Kansas accused
me of selling my countrymen to a life not much better than
slavery in a land of ice, snow, and perpetual winter, where,
if the poor emigrant did not starve to death, he would
surely perish with cold. Such at that time was the opinion
of many concerning Minnesota.”<a id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The secretaries or commissioners of immigration were
usually men of alien birth or extraction, and therefore
intelligent and sympathetic in their labors for succeeding
immigrants.<a id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Probably no State gave better care, guidance,
and protection to foreigners coming as settlers than
did Minnesota, and naturally, with a Swede as commissioner,
the Scandinavians were “preferred stock.” The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>work of the Minnesota commission included the appointment
of interpreters to meet immigrants at New York,
Montreal, and Quebec and accompany them to Minnesota;
provision for temporary homes for the new-comers until
they went to their chosen locality; and wide publication of
newspaper articles in different languages. Pamphlets containing
maps and detailed descriptions of States and
counties were distributed at railroad stations and on
steamers, in America and in foreign countries.<a id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> It would
be stretching the truth a little to say that these circulars
sent out by States, counties, and railroad companies were
always strictly accurate and ingenuous, but they brought
the desired results, not in one campaign alone, but year
after year. Taken as a whole the energies of the State and
railroad agents, were honorable, well-managed, and highly
beneficial to both the States and the immigrants. The best
evidence for this statement lies in the figures of the censuses
of 1880, 1890, and 1900 for the population of Wisconsin,
Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas.<a id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The value of so many tens of thousands of immigrants
added to the assets of western commonwealths,—so many
scores of thousands of “hands,” to make use of the colloquial
term for labor units,—is at once great and difficult
to measure or estimate. In economic terms, how much
is a full-grown, healthy, intelligent, literate young man
worth to a community into which he drops himself, for is
he not as much a finished labor-performing machine as a
new traction engine or a span of mules, either of which the
assessor would set down in his books? The risks and pains
and costs of up-bringing through unproductive years, of
educating, of training for occupation, have all been borne
by another community; the increment of wealth arising
from his labor, providence, and skill will enrich the United
States.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet it is not a fair test of the value of an immigrant
to this country to measure it by the cost of his bringing up
and education, either by the standards of his old home
or by the American standards. Professor Mayo-Smith
pointed out the fallacy in the oft-quoted estimate of Kapp,
made up on this basis, that “the capital value of each male
and female immigrant was about $1,500 and $750
respectively, making an average of $1125.”<a id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Dr. Young,
formerly Chief of the United States Bureau of Statistics,
chooses as a basis the “market value” rather than the “cost
of production,” and estimates the approximate yearly addition
made by each immigrant to the realized wealth of the
country in the form of farms, buildings, stock, tools, and
savings, to be about $40, which, capitalized at 5%, gives
$800 as the value of each immigrant.<a id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> An interesting
German calculation in 1881, made in much the same way as
Dr. Young’s, put the capital value of each immigrant at
$1,200.<a id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Another method of gauging the amount contributed
to the earnings of the country by each immigrant,
is to multiply the average daily wage of $1 by one-fifth the
total number of immigrants, and that by 300, the number
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>of working days in the year.<a id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Taking the values of the
immigrant over fourteen years of age and under forty-five,
as $1000, and estimating conservatively that 80 per-cent of
the foreign-born enumerated in the census of 1900 reached
the United States between those ages, the Scandinavians so
enumerated represented a capital value of about $850,000,000,
to which the immigration from the North countries
in the next five years added not less than $230,000,000.
Viewed from one point, this capital was just so much given
by the gods of plenty to accelerate the development of
the West.</p>

<p>Another phase of the economic advantages of Scandinavian
immigration has to do with the cash capital brought
by the incoming thousands. While the first Norwegians
were of the poorest class of the community, who escaped
from unfavorable conditions almost empty-handed,
squeezed out from the bottom of society, as it were through
cracks and crevices, and while many of the later arrivals
have had no other capital than strong hands and equally
strong determination, the great proportion of adults have
brought with them average sums variously estimated from
$22 to $70 each. G. H. Schwab of New York, whose firm
was general American agent for the North German Lloyd
Steamship Company, estimated the average money or
money equivalent brought by the Scandinavians, at $22
per head, probably including children in the calculation.<a id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
W. W. Thomas, Jr., Commissioner of Immigration for
Maine, and later minister to Sweden, states that 900 Swedes
who came to Maine in one year, besides clothing, tools, and
household goods, had $40,000 in cash; and elsewhere he
puts the average at $50 per head.<a id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The figures from Wisconsin,
which received better material than the average,
would naturally run higher; in 1880 the official estimate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>of cash brought by each immigrant was “from $60 to $70.”<a id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Assuming an average of 50,000 Scandinavian immigrants
per year for the last thirty years,—a safe minimum—and
an average of $50 cash per capita, the annual addition to
the cash capital of the country would be at least $2,500,000.</p>

<p>Whatever may be gained in this way is, however, offset
by the steady stream of remittances flowing from America
to Northern Europe, especially during the last quarter of
a century, and by the large sums spent by the thousands of
erstwhile immigrants returning to their old homes for a
winter or for a vacation.<a id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Many a son, prospering in
America, has contributed regularly to the support or added
comfort of his parents or family in the fatherland; every
holiday season swells the mail sacks with letters containing
money-orders and drafts. During 1902 at least $1,000,000
was sent to Norway alone.<a id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In the last two months of
1903, it is estimated that $3,000,000 went from the United
States to the Scandinavian countries in these personal remittances.<a id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Another sort of remittance which does not
immediately take the form of cash, is the prepaid ticket
for passage to an American port, sent to friends and relatives
to assist them to emigrate. The United States consuls
at Bergen and Gothenburg reported that about one-half
of the emigrants from Norway and Sweden in 1891 made
the journey on tickets sent from America.<a id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In this connection,
it should be noted that the money thus spent by immigrants
is not in the nature of a permanent investment of
hoarded earnings; it is not the remittance of “birds of
passage” like some Italians, for example, who will shortly
follow it. In comparison with the millions of dollars sent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>home by Italian immigrants in an average year, the Scandinavian
remittances and spendings are almost insignificant.<a id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>From the first, great numbers of the immigrants have
come with no other capital than strong and willing hands,
stout hearts, and an unchanging land-hunger. They served
for a time as laborers on the older farms, in town, in the
lumber camps, or in railroad construction, saving their
money, learning American ways, and acquiring some
English, but as soon as money enough was saved, perhaps in
a year, to buy forty or eighty acres of government land at
the minimum price, a yoke of oxen or a team of horses, and
a few necessary farm tools and implements, the prospective
farmer moved upon new land and started out for himself.
Under the Homestead Act of 1862 the amount of capital
required for the beginning of operations was greatly reduced,
and it was under this act that the lands of the
northwestern States beyond the Mississippi were so rapidly
taken up.<a id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>A typical illustration of the process described is found
in Levor Timanson, who came with his father in 1848, at
the age of eighteen, to Rock County, Wisconsin, where he
worked for several years as farm laborer, carpenter, and
mason. He visited Iowa and Minnesota in 1853 in search
of satisfactory land; finding it at Spring Grove, in the
latter State, he settled down there as a grain and stock
farmer. In 1882 he owned 840 acres of land of which 550
acres were under cultivation.<a id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> A study of the histories of
counties and townships in eastern Iowa and Minnesota, and
of the biographies which usually accompany them, reveals
clearly the fact that the larger part of the Scandinavian
farmers resident in those counties in the sixties and seventies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>spent from one to five years in Wisconsin or Illinois
before moving into the Farther West.<a id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> They were in turn
apprentices and journeymen, and finally attained to the
full dignity of masters of their own estates.</p>

<p>The economic as well as the social importance of the
tendency of the Scandinavian immigrants to settle upon the
unoccupied farm lands of the West, can scarcely be over-emphasized.
It gains still more striking significance when
the figures showing such settlement are compared with
those of some other races which have more recently contributed
largely to the immigrant population; for the man
who owns and develops a farm necessarily makes a permanent,
long-time investment of himself and his family in
a reproductively extractive industry; while the wage-earner
in the mines or in lumbering is quite likely to be a “bird of
passage,” engaged in destructively extractive industries,
with only vague notions of, or longings for, citizenship and
its responsibilities. Professor John R. Commons, perhaps
the best statistical authority on this subject, gives some
striking figures illustrative of the farm-ward tendencies
of different alien elements, showing the percentage of total
number of males in 1890 engaged (1) on farms, (2) as
farmers and planters, and (3) as laborers not specified:<a id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>From calculations based upon the reports of the censuses
of 1870, 1880, and 1890, it appears that one out of four of
the Scandinavians was in the last year engaged in agriculture;
of the Americans, one out of five; of the Germans,
one out of six; and of the Irish, one out of twelve.<a id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>One of the very natural consequences of the tendency
of the Norse immigrants to seek agricultural locations, and
to seek them along the advancing frontier, is the township
and even the county, particularly in Minnesota and the
Dakotas,<a id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> peopled
almost solidly with the men and women of one nationality. The names of post-offices
and townships, and the assessment rolls of the counties, bear witness
to the density of these settlements which were made up of
immigrants in both the first and second stages, composed in
part of people coming from the older colonies like those in
Dane County, Wisconsin, or Henry County, Illinois, or
Goodhue County, Minnesota, and in part of newcomers direct
from their Old World homes. About 1880, the names
of those whose land abutted upon the two railroads traversing
Houston County, Minnesota showed plainly this process
of massing. Taken in order, the first twenty-two names
were those of American, Irish, and German settlers; then
followed nineteen, all Scandinavian save two.<a id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Fillmore
County, Minnesota, one of the older counties, largely Norwegian
from its beginning, and Chisago County, on the
eastern border of the same State, a stronghold of the
Swedes from its first settlement, are excellent examples of
the economic contributions made to the State by the Scandinavian
element through its development of the wilderness
into cultivated fields and prosperous villages. Of the transformation
of Dakota before 1890, and the part of the sons
of the North in it, a writer says: “Most of them came with
just enough to get on Government land and build a
shack.... Now they are loaning money to their less
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>fortunate
neighbors.... Every county has Norwegians who are worth from $25,000 to $50,000,
all made since settling in Dakota.”<a id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>In comparing statistics of such counties as Fillmore
and Chisago, showing their growth in wealth and productivity,
as reported in the decennial census, two facts regarding
the nativity and parentage of the population must be
kept clearly in mind if the full significance of the work of
the men of alien stock is to be appreciated: first, that the
increase of the foreign born is largely made up of adults;
second, that the increase of the native-born is in reality an
increase of the purely Norwegian or Swedish element, the
sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of foreign-born
parents, for the census-taker, even in 1900, did
not penetrate beyond the first degree of ancestry.</p>

<p>The tabulation given in Appendix II illustrates the
economic progress of three Minnesota counties in which the
Norse factor has been strong from the early days of their
settlement: Fillmore, Chisago, and Otter Tail, one of the
newer counties in the west-central part of the State. From
these figures some conception of the influence of the North
European in one American commonwealth may be obtained.
These are not unique cases, but rather they are what might be called normal
  counties of their class, counties whose population is made up more or less
  of good native-born settlers from the older Eastern States.</p>

<p>Several processes already discussed will be easily and
forcibly illustrated by these tables. In Fillmore County,
for example, the oldest of the three, the increase of the
foreign-born element was most rapid in the decade 1870-1880,
while during the next ten years there was a distinct
falling off, due beyond any doubt to the rise in the price
of lands in that county and to the opening up of new
counties like Otter Tail where just as good land was to
be had at the minimum rate. This falling off was paralleled
in the same decade in Chisago County, while both
the rise and decline in the number of foreign-born Norwegians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>going into Otter Tail County occur in the two
later decades, 1880-1890 and 1890-1900, when the Dakotas
were filling up.</p>

<p>The continuing additions to the acreage of farm lands
and the steady transformation of unimproved areas into
improved areas, indicate the extent to which the labor of
alien hands was enhancing the value of the prairies even
down to 1900, and presumably since that date. The figures
for the increase of the cash values of the farms, including
fences, etc., but not improvements, have been chosen because
the increases in the total valuations of counties is
not infrequently due to the rise of considerable villages and
cities, and to the building of railroads, and to these enterprises
in contrast with the evolution of agricultural values,
the Scandinavian is a comparatively insignificant contributor.
The extent to which this development of rural
areas may go, is curiously evidenced in the names of the
subdivisions of the relatively new Otter Tail County. Of
its sixty-two townships in 1900, not less than thirteen bear
unmistakable Scandinavian (Norwegian) names—Aastad,
Aurdal, Norwegian Grove, St. Olaf, Tordenskjold, Throndhjem,
etc.</p>

<p>The price which the immigrant-agriculturist was willing
to pay for his coveted free-hold farm was not measured
in dollars and cents alone. In a very real way, the
land was to become the property of the highest bidder, tho
each one paid $1.25 per acre; the land was sure to go to
him who would in the long run put the most of himself
into the bargain—muscle, courage, patience, pride in his
family, and the future of himself and his family as over
against the present. It was due in no small degree to the
composite nature of this individual investment by the
man from Europe’s Northwest, that he so promptly and
intelligently succeeded in acquiring free of debt his farm
and home in the American Northwest.<a id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>Another reason for his nearly uniform success lies in
the fact that he was brought up to a more careful and intensive
system of farming than his average American
neighbor. Perhaps, too, he works harder than the American,
but hard work, long and unflinchingly continued, is a
fundamental condition of the success of a farmer whatever
his nationality. From the Scandinavian immigrant’s point
of view, he does not work so hard in the United States,
in order to gain a given result,—ownership of his own
farm, for illustration,—as he would have had to work
in the land of his birth. Personal interviews with scores
of men in various parts of the Northwest confirm the
opinion expressed to Miss Bremer in Wisconsin so far back
as 1850, when pioneering was as hard as at any time since
the “Sloop Folk” landed in New York: “About seven
hundred Norwegian colonists are settled in this neighborhood,
all upon small farms.... I asked many, both men
and women, whether they were contented; whether they
were better off here or in old Norway. Nearly all of them
replied, ‘<i>Yes</i>, we are better off here; we do not work so
hard, and it is easier to gain a livelihood.’”<a id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>In a discussion of the competition of the immigrants
with American laborers, an eminent scholar maintains
that the Scandinavians of the West have succeeded where
the American with a better start has failed.<a id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> He questions
if this success is a survival of the fittest, if it has not
been purchased at the expense of American labor which is
forced elsewhere, because the Americans will not endure
the hard work and live on the coarse fare, through which
the immigrants win their success.<a id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> However true this
might be as a generalization about immigrants as a whole,
it can hardly be true of the Swedes and Norwegians, except
in so far as they have been more willing than the native
American to live the life of a pioneer and to stick to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>soil. But this cannot fairly be called forcing out American
labor, or driving the American to the wall; immigrant
labor went in where there was no labor of any kind.
Furthermore, up to 1890, there was certainly plenty of
land for all the American, or native-born, laborers who
desired to devote themselves to that sort of work by which
the Scandinavians were gaining their independence. If
the agricultural land of the vast West be looked upon as
a national asset, to be held for cautious and discriminating
distribution to examined and approved settlers, then it
may be that the foreigner has occupied land which might
have sometime fallen to a better man.</p>

<p>The standard of living among the Scandinavian settlers,
whether on the frontier or in the towns, has not been
very different from that of their American neighbors. It
cannot vary much in a sod-house on the prairie, in a cabin
on a claim, or in a log-hut in a clearing, whether the occupant
be of Viking or Puritan descent.<a id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The food was
Indian corn, sometimes ground in a coffee-mill, occasionally
wheat, milk, fish, wild fowl, pork, and common vegetables;
the clothing was often primitive and always rough, and in
the early days, at least, “men in wooden shoes and home-made
woolen jackets were no uncommon sights at their
religious meetings, or even when they were locked in holy
matrimony before the altar.”<a id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> But with prosperity,
Americanization, and the settling up of the region about
them, they took to comforts and luxuries just as soon as
they could afford them. During the autumn of 1886 the
writer spent more than six weeks in the family of a well-to-do
Danish farmer in central Minnesota, and made frequent
calls at the homes of Swedish and American
neighbors; very little perceptible difference could be
observed in the standards of living, whether judged by
furniture, dress, or food. In the gradations up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>wealthy families of the larger towns and cities, the same
statement would be true. If any modifications were to be
made, it would be that Scandinavians set a more bountiful
table, and give more attention than the Americans to
festivals and celebrations.</p>

<p>The men of Scandinavian stock have by no means devoted
themselves exclusively to agriculture, tho it has
already been shown how dominant with them is the desire
for the possession of land and the independence which that
possession brings. In business—trade, manufacturing, and
finance,—and in the professions, in all that differentiates
the village or urban community from time rural, they have,
especially since 1890, played an active part. A rising
percentage of skilled laborers and of those who had in the
Old World experience with business affairs, marked the
immigration from Northern Europe after 1880. The
accumulated wealth of the earlier immigrants sought
investment in the thriving towns of the newer commonwealths
of the Northwest. Villages which sprang up along
railroads, became cities with the advent of other lines;
water power has developed fast; the forests were to be
turned into lumber and its further manufactured products.
The Scandinavian villages and wards of great cities evolved
their own stores, shops, factories, and banks just as they
did their churches, lodges, and other social organizations,
manned by men of ambition, ability, skill, and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>Both in the cities like Chicago, Minneapolis, Rockford,
and Madison, and in the more homogeneous villages of the
solidly Scandinavian counties, Norwegian and Swedish
merchants and tradesmen, catering to Americans as well as
to persons of their own nationality, rapidly achieved success
and fortune. Seven years after landing, a Swedish
immigrant is reported in 1873 to have built up in Anoka,
Minnesota, the largest grocery establishment in that section,
doing an annual business of $100,000.<a id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In the city of
Minneapolis one of the largest department stores west of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Chicago, and probably the greatest Scandinavian business
house in the country, is that of S. E. Olson &amp; Co., which
does a yearly business of about $2,000,000, and in the
height of the season employs more than 700 persons.<a id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Scattered over the Northwest are scores of enterprising
Scandinavian individuals and firms engaged in business
as merchants, grain-dealers, contractors, etc., whose annual
business passes $100,000.<a id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The manufacturing industries in which the Swedes and
Norwegians play the more active part are those closely
related to agriculture and the forest—the cutting and
sawing of lumber, the manufacture of furniture, and the
manufacture of agricultural implements. By foresight
and shrewd investments in timber lands in Wisconsin and
Minnesota, a certain Norwegian immigrant accumulated
nearly a million dollars; a Swedish immigrant in like
manner built up the C. A. Smith Lumber Company of Minneapolis,
one of the great manufacturers of the upper
Mississippi Valley, with works occupying seventy acres,
employing upwards of 800 men, and with branch lumber
yards situated in western Minnesota and in the Dakotas.<a id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The manufacture of furniture is the chief occupation
of the Swedes of Rockford, Illinois, who comprise fully
one-third of that city’s population of 30,000. In 1875
fifteen Swedes organized the Forest City Furniture Company,
with a capital of $50,000; ten years later, Rockford
was the second city in the country in the production of
furniture, and in 1893 there were more than twenty furniture
companies with a capital varying from $50,000 to
$200,000. Nearly all of these companies were organized on
the co-operative basis, nearly all were composed of Swedes,
and nearly all were earning a clear profit of 20 per-cent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>and upwards.<a id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Other notable instances of successful
Scandinavian manufacturers are John A. Johnson, whose
works for making agricultural implements in Madison, Wisconsin,
employed about 300 men; the great printing and
publishing house of John Anderson &amp; Company of Chicago,
from which are issued the daily and weekly editions of
“Skandinaven,” and the Swedish-American Publishing
Company of Minneapolis, publishing the widely circulated
“Svenska Amerikanska Posten.”<a id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The economic progress of the immigrants from the
Northlands may well be gauged by the number of public and
private banking establishments in the Northwest controlled
by them. Surprisingly numerous are the men who, after
gaining a competency as merchants, grain-dealers (one of
these built twenty-five elevators along the Great Northern
Railway), land speculators, and lumbermen, have turned
to banking as their communities developed. The market
for capital was active, ready to absorb large or small
amounts; rates of interest ran from ten to twenty per cent.;
the thrift and honesty of the Norse folk were equivalent to
a bond. Hence small banks with $25,000 and $50,000
capital multiplied, not always on the soundest basis, it
should be said, though this does not imply dishonesty. In
Minneapolis, between 1874 and 1900, the names of no less
than six Scandinavian banks appear, the largest becoming
the strong Swedish American National Bank with a capital
of $250,000.<a id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Smaller cities like Sioux City and Boone,
Iowa, have developed similar sound banks capitalized for
$100,000. Not all Scandinavian bankers, however, have
escaped the temptations of “high finance,” though the total
of failures is comparatively small. One of the most notorious
and shameful examples of bank-wrecking in recent
years occurred in Chicago in 1906, when Paul O. Stensland,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>for years the trusted and honored and admired president
of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank, the depository of
hundreds of working men and small tradesmen, wrecked
the bank through speculations in real estate, fled to Africa,
and was brought back and placed in the Joliet prison for a
term of fifteen years.<a id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>As the regions into which the Scandinavian immigrants
have gone so determinedly as agricultural settlers
have gradually become more complex in their economic
structure, these men and women have once more illustrated
their notable capacity to adapt themselves to the
new conditions and to share in new advantages. The second
and third generation will probably develop much the
same tendency city-ward which the Americans of the same
class show so markedly; and they will take their share of
the honors and emoluments of business, manufacturing,
banking, the technical professions, and the so-called
learned professions.</p>

<h2 class="chapnumber"><a id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">The Religious and Intellectual Standpoint</p>


<p>The social results of the settlement of a body of aliens
in any country, as compared with the economic, are far
more undefinable and elusive, even when the settlement is
compact and homogenous, like that of the Dutch in New
York or the French in Louisiana. But when a particular
element, like the Irish or the Scandinavian, in a complex
population, is distributed over a wide area, with accessions
running through three-quarters of a century, the problem
of its social influence and importance becomes vastly more
difficult. No study or observation of such a well-established
racial group, outside of the purely statistical, at best
can reach far beyond an impression or an individual opinion;
it cannot arrive at a convincing and conclusive scientific
deduction.<a id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Looked at in its length and breadth, the
question of social results of Scandinavian immigration
takes various forms. Have the foreign-born citizen and his
immediate descendants adapted themselves rapidly and
vitally to the best American customs in business, politics,
education, and religion? Have they learned English
quickly? What has been their attitude towards such questions
as intemperance, slavery, and public honesty? Are
they re-enforcing the best standards of public and private
morality prevailing in the communities into which they
come?</p>

<p>Fundamental to this discussion, is the general effect
of the process of immigration and new settlement, upon the
physical and intellectual state of the immigrant and his
offspring. It has already been pointed out that the immigrants
of the nineteenth century, like those hardy souls of
the sixteenth, who left England, Holland, France, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Sweden, were the more adventurous and determined men
and women of their parishes, and that the incidents and
anxieties of settling up affairs in their old homes and of
getting off for America, would stir to quicker thinking the
minds of even the slow and inert. Then came the influence
of adjustment to the ways of a new and larger world, with
its greater distance, its more rapid communication, its
more strenuous activities, its new language, and its different
climate and diet; all these re-enforced the original,
quickened impulse, and of necessity affected both subtly
and powerfully the mind and body of two generations.</p>

<p>The change has in general been for the better, tho
some observers think they see a retrogression, especially
in physical respects. A Norwegian physician who spent
about nine months in the United States in 1892, wrote for
a Christiania medical journal an article in which he declared:
“That the Norwegian race in the United States is
declining physically, every one, I think, who has spent some
time among our emigrated countrymen there must admit.
But the change is a slow one.” The causes, as he saw
them, were the unwholesome climate of the Northwest, the
unsuitable food of the farmers, the cold, damp houses of
the prairies, and the abuse of alcoholic liquors and tobacco.
By way of final summary of opinions, he states that “the
general rule is that, these dark sides to the contrary notwithstanding,
the social conditions in America and its
democratic institutions are conducive to individual thinking
thereby contributing to the development of individual
talent, great or small as that may be.”<a id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The views of Dr. Kraft were more or less disputed by
several Norwegian physicians in the United States, in <i>The
North</i> for January and February, 1893. Dr. Harold Graff,
writing to the periodical in which Dr. Kraft’s article
originally appeared, says: “With astonishing rapidity, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>wide mouth and ungainly nose of the specific Norwegian
peasant type become modified and disappear, the difference
between the physiognomy and facial expression of parents
and children being often bewilderingly great.... I have
interviewed some of the oldest and most experienced
physicians practising in this country, and also other intelligent
Norwegians who have travelled among their countrymen
in the States, without as yet having heard any
divergent opinion whatever. All agree that the Norwegian
race in every respect is progressing in both mind and
body.”<a id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Others, who were not so sure of the physical improvement,
agree as to the intellectual quickening. In a
word, if the transplanting of the tree has not certainly
produced an improved trunk or foliage, it has bettered the
quality of the fruit. The next logical step is to attempt to
estimate the value of such fruit in the American market.</p>

<p>The two obvious ways of determining the influence of
a foreign element, are to compare it with some other
foreign-born constituent longer and better known, and to
compare it with the native American. The latter is the
fairer criterion, but it is not easy to ascertain and define
what are the purely American characteristics with which
comparison is to be made. Statistics on social matters are
so incomplete that reliance must be placed upon the consensus
of opinion of thoughtful, sympathetic observers and
students of American life, whether they be statesmen and
philosophers bred in the United States, or scholarly, penetrating
foreigners like James Bryce and Alexander de
Toqueville.<a id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Such men of insight agree that the American
ideal comprises love of freedom, independence, and equality;
respect for law, government, education, and social
morality (including reverence for the family and the
home); and lastly a willingness to share the common burden
and, if need be, to make a common sacrifice for the
permanent welfare of the commonwealth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>In acquiring the use of English and in maintaining
high standards of education, the Scandinavians have an
unimpeachable record which no other foreign, non-English-speaking
element can equal. Illiteracy in Norway and
Sweden is almost unknown. Taken together, these two
kingdoms have less than one per-cent of illiteracy, and
among the recruits in Sweden in 1896 only .13% were
unlettered, and only .63% were unable to write.<a id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Personal
acquaintance with many hundreds of Scandinavians,
on both sides of the Atlantic, has failed to reveal to the
writer a single adult who was unable to read and write.</p>

<p>One of the very first matters to receive attention in a
Scandinavian settlement in the United States, has been
the establishment of a school, and, as speedily as possible,
the instruction has been given in English, partly because
the school laws of most of the States would not recognize
a public school conducted in a foreign language, and
partly because the settlers desired to have the children
know English.<a id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> For a year or two in some of the isolated
communities, as in Arendahl, Fillmore County, Minnesota,
in 1857-8, it was necessary to conduct the schools in Swedish
or Norwegian; but only rarely has any attempt been
made to continue systematic, regular instruction exclusively
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>in the mother-tongue by the maintenance of year-long
parish schools. The immigrants have frequently been
insistent, and properly so, upon some scheme by which
they might be able to educate their children in the use of
the mother-tongue; but schools for this purpose have usually
supplemented rather than supplanted the ordinary
public school.<a id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In a very few localities, like the older
settlements in Goodhue County and Fillmore County,
Minnesota, Allamakee County, Iowa, and Dane County,
Wisconsin, parish schools are still maintained throughout
the year.<a id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>The church schools are more commonly a sort of
summer vacation school supported either by the persons
whose children attend, or at the expense of the whole congregation;
in them are taught the language of the parents
and the preacher, the church catechism, and something of
church history; sometimes especial attention, as in the case
of the Danish Grundtvigian “high schools,” is given to
keeping alive the traditions of the European kingdom from
which sprang the immigrants. The teacher of both the
language and the doctrines of religion is customarily a
student in some theological seminary of the denomination
to which the congregation belongs. The Lutherans have
kept up these vacation schools more consistently than any
other Scandinavian church. The report of the parochial
schools of the United Norwegian Lutheran Church for
1905 showed that on the average almost thirty days were
devoted to the church school in each of the 750 congregations
reporting.<a id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The clergy are mainly active in this mild paternalism,
upon which the younger people not infrequently look
with disfavor, for to the second generation it appears an
unnecessary perpetuation of an un-American custom, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>scheme for emphasizing peculiarities and differences rather
than a means of hastening the process of amalgamation.
Sometimes the younger men have revolted and broken
entirely with the Lutheran church, identifying themselves
with American congregations, or drifting out on the wide
sea of religious indifference.</p>

<p>The loyalty of the Scandinavians to the public school
system has been of far-reaching consequence to the immigrants
themselves as well as to American society. There
is always a more or less strongly marked tendency among
aliens speaking a foreign language to congregate in groups
in the country or in certain wards in large towns and
cities, and out of this tendency springs a sort of clannishness
which cannot be avoided and which is not peculiar
to any class, for the immigrants naturally follow the lines
of least resistance. They go to those whom they know, to
those whose speech they can understand, to those from
whose experience they may draw large drafts of suggestion
and help. But this clannishness with the Swedes, Norwegians
and Danes, has been but a stage in their evolution
out of which, through the gates of the English language,
public schools, naturalization, and increased prosperity,
they have passed to broader relations. The filling up of
the Scandinavian quarters of great cities like Chicago,
Minneapolis, and St. Paul, may modify the effect of their
persistent attachment to the public school; but so far the
public school is the great foe to clannishness, and loyalty
to it one of the best evidences of the desire of these people
from the Northern lands to become Americanized. In the
cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, with their large Scandinavian
population, there was not in 1907 a single parish
in which the parochial school lasted through the year, and
only a few in which vacation schools were maintained.</p>

<p>In higher education the Scandinavians have allowed
their denominational zeal to outrun their judgment. They
have founded numerous seminaries and so-called colleges,
but almost invariably as a part of the necessary equipment
of a religious denomination, for how could a self-respecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sect, no matter how young or how slightly differentiated
from its older brethren, permit its children to
attend the schools of those whose denominational beliefs
or practices had become objectionable enough to warrant
a schism in the church? A few of these institutions, like
Luther College, at Decorah, Iowa, Gustavus Adolphus College
at St. Peter, Minnesota, Augustana College at Rock
Island, Illinois, and Bethany College at Lindsborg, Kansas,
have maintained an excellent standard of work and
exercise a wide and beneficent influence.<a id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The great majority,
however, have simply wasted resources by the multiplication
of ambitious, struggling, poorly-equipped, so-called
colleges, with little or no endowment, and often
dependent upon the congregations of the denomination
which gave them birth.<a id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>One of the results of the excessive splitting-up of the
Scandinavian churches is that the energies which ought to
be concentrated are frittered away on unnecessary schools.
A separate denominational school and a family paper seem
to be indispensable parts of the machinery of every newly
organized sect, no matter how young or how small or how
poor it may be.<a id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The number of these institutions continually
varies with the ups and downs of the denominations
trying to support them. In 1893, Mr. J. J. Skordalsvold,
a graduate of the University of Minnesota, put the number
of Scandinavian colleges, schools, and seminaries in the
United States at thirty-six, with an attendance of about
five thousand.<a id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Sixteen of these, with an attendance of
twenty-five hundred, one-half of the total, were located in
Minnesota. By 1900 the sixteen had grown to twenty
schools, having property worth $500,000, one hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>sixty teachers, and three thousand students.<a id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> In that
state, however, and in others like North Dakota, these
schools are likely to follow the same course as many of
the schools of other pioneering Protestant denominations,
and become little more than preparatory schools on the
one hand, or theological seminaries on the other, leaving
to the State university the maintenance of higher education
in every field save arts and theology. Even as secondary
schools, not many of them will be likely to survive
the third generation of the original immigrants, unless
they are much better endowed than any one of them is at
the present time.<a id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The Red Wing Seminary (Hauge
Synod) of Red Wing, Minnesota, founded in 1878, is essentially
an ordinary private secondary school with a theological
course attached, and three-fourths of its work is
conducted in English.<a id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Bethany College at Lindsborg,
Kansas, one of the three prosperous Swedish colleges, and
perhaps the most ambitious, is substantially an English-speaking
college, with nine departments of instruction,
and in 1912 a registration of 919. Only in the classes in
Swedish language and literature is the instruction given
in Swedish, tho “Swedish is required of all students preparing
to enter the ministerial work of our Swedish Evangelical
Lutheran Church.”<a id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Luther College, the Norwegian
institution at Decorah, Iowa, has followed along the
same course only not quite so far. Several years ago the
proportion between English and Norwegian as media of
instruction was slightly in favor of the English in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>college classes; in the classes in the preparatory department,
in the literary societies, and in the conversation of
the students, English was decidedly predominant.<a id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The
practice of this, the oldest, and in some respects the soundest
and most influential, of the Scandinavian colleges, is
sure to be adopted by the lesser schools which survive their
adolescence.</p>

<p>From a religious standpoint, the most noteworthy
characteristic of Scandinavians wherever found, is their
intense Protestantism. Everywhere and always they are
uncompromising enemies of the Roman Catholic church,
and there are barely enough Catholics among them in
Europe and in the United States to prove that it is possible
to convert one of them to that faith. In fact, their dislike
of Catholicism is an instinct coming down from Reformation
times rather than a matter of experience or close-at-hand
observation; but so strong is this feeling that it
colors, consciously or unconsciously, their relations in
politics and society in the United States. Their distrust
of the Irish is at bottom more a religious than a racial
instinct, even when it takes an active form. While this
dislike and suspicion are still real and large, it has undoubtedly
been reduced by the breaking-up of the old rigid
lines of Lutheranism, which has taken place in the last two
decades in the United States.</p>

<p>Each of the three peninsular kingdoms of Northern
Europe has an established Lutheran church, administered
by bishops, which holds still the great majority of the
people. Toleration has been generally practiced for a
half century, the sole exception being the ban against
Jesuits in Norway.<a id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Of all the Protestant churches, none
is more rigidly orthodox than the Lutheran, none is more
unwilling to admit changes in its traditional creed; only
a few years ago, the Norwegian Synod in America re-affirmed
its belief in the literal inspiration of the Bible.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Yet in spite of this conservatism, the Lutherans settled in
the United States have invariably rejected the episcopal
form of government, and have organized upon a more or
less democratic basis. No matter how loyal they were to
the Establishment in the Old World, a bishop has not
appeared to be necessary to their happiness or salvation
in the New. The Lutheran Church proper has kept within
its folds a much larger percentage of Swedes than of Norwegians
in the United States, the characteristic independence
of the latter leading many of them even farther than
mere separation from the mother-church. The persistence
of the centrifugal force of dissent shows itself again and
again in the violent polemics and divisions which have
marked the course of Norwegian church history in America.<a id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
While this divisiveness may in some degree be due
to the fashion set by the early settlers of whom many were
dissenters, probably the deeper cause is to be found in the
general freedom from religious restriction and prescription
which characterizes the whole United States and especially
the West.</p>

<p>Even the more extreme sects, in regard to belief and
practice, have been recruited from among the Scandinavians
both before and since their coming to this country.
The Mormons were early at work as missionaries in Northern
Europe and, as has been stated above, won many
converts, particularly in Denmark, from whose immigration
Utah mainly profited. In 1900 Utah had a total
foreign-born population of 53,777, of whom 9132 were
Danes; 7025, Swedes; and 2128, Norwegians. The real
result of the missionary work, however, is better seen in
the figures for persons having both parents born in a
specified country and residing in Utah in 1900: Danes,
18,963; Swedes, 12,047; Norwegians, 3,466; total, 34,476.<a id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>The American churches and missionary societies were
not unmindful of the needs of the Scandinavians scattered
over the Middle West in the early days of its development,
and in zealous and effective fashion gave them aid. The
work of the Hedström brothers in New York and in the
West, already described, reflects credit on the Methodist
Church. Once at least, help came to them from an unexpected
source: Jenny Lind, the “Swedish Nightingale,”
devoted to charity the proceeds of a concert in New York,
in November, 1850, and among the items of the distribution
of the total of $5073.20 by a committee, is “To the Relief
of the Poor Swedes and Norwegians in the city of New
York per the Rev. Mr. Hedström, $273.20. To the distribution
of Swedish Bibles and Testaments, in New York.”<a id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Besides the Bethel Ship in New York Harbor (1845), this
same church established a Scandinavian mission in the
Rock River Conference, in Illinois, in 1849, and two others
in Iowa and Wisconsin in 1850. Three years later the
report showed two Swedish missions with four missionaries,
and two Norwegian missions with four missionaries.<a id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The American Lutheran churches undertook to aid
their co-religionists, and in 1850 the Pittsburg Synod and
the Joint Synod of Ohio each sent one of its ministers into
the Northwest, but the epidemic of cholera caused them
to hurry back to their former homes.<a id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The real support
of some of the immigrant Lutheran missionaries came
from the American Home Missionary Society (Congregational).
One of the men thus assisted was Paul Anderson
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>(Norland) who came from Norway in 1843, and received
a part of his education in the new Congregational college
at Beloit. He was chosen pastor of the first Norwegian
Lutheran Church in Chicago in 1848, and journeyed to
Albany, New York, to be ordained by a Lutheran minister,
but he nevertheless served under a commission from the
Congregational Society, and made reports to it for several
years.<a id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>In a similar manner this Society supported for several
years the missionary labors of Lars Paul Esbjörn, a graduate
of Upsala University, who was ordained a Lutheran
clergyman when he emigrated in 1849, and likewise the
labors of T. N. Hasselquist. Esbjörn was appointed a
missionary of the Society in December, 1849, on the recommendation
of the Central Association of Congregational
Ministers of Illinois, to whom he presented his credentials
and by whom he was examined and received into the
Association.<a id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> He was re-appointed year by year, making
reports from 1851 to 1854.<a id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Hasselquist makes acknowledgment
of his obligations to the Society in a letter of
July, 1853, saying that he rejoices “in connection with
your in the highest sense benevolent Society, without
which it would have been impossible for me to do for my
scattered countrymen what I have done.... I give
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>humble thanks to the Home Missionary Association which
out of Christian benevolence helps to build up the Kingdom
of Christ among scattered Swedes who are almost all very
poor, but still love the word of God.”<a id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In 1852 the Society
appointed the Rev. Ole Anderson [Andrewson?] to the
charge of the Scandinavian church in Racine, Wisconsin,
and two years later he reports to the Society from La Salle
County, Illinois.<a id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>Since the Civil War and the great increase in the
numbers of immigrants, the home missionary efforts of the
Methodists, Congregationalists, and Baptists have been
carried on with persistence, if not always with perfect
wisdom. In 1911 the Methodists had five Swedish Conferences
with 222 churches, a membership of about 18,000,
and property valued at upwards of $2,000,000, and two
Norwegian-Danish Conferences, with 119 churches, 6,300
members, and property worth $400,000.<a id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The cost of this
work to the Methodist Missionary Society is not far from
$50,000 per year.<a id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The Baptists began their proselyting
work in Norway and Sweden, and have prosecuted it steadily
in the Northwest since the establishment of the first
Swedish Baptist church in Rock Island, Illinois, in 1852.
In 1912 the church reports showed 18 Swedish conferences,
374 churches, 28,000 members, and current income of
about $350,000, and also eleven Norwegian-Danish conferences,
94 churches, 5,900 members, and current income of
$65,500.<a id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The Congregationalists have pushed their denominational
interests in like manner, and in 1913 had
about one hundred churches, with rather more than six
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>thousand members.<a id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Besides these churches regularly
connected with the Congregational organization, there are
about one hundred congregations of the Swedish Mission
Union, and the group of independent congregations whose
faith and practice are closely allied with those of the
Congregationalists.<a id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The Unitarian church has endeavored
to organize congregations, spending $25,000 on one
church in Minneapolis in sixteen years.<a id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> A few Protestant
Episcopal parishes also exist among the Swedes,
chiefly in the large cities.<a id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The three denominations first mentioned have for
many years maintained, in their respective western theological
seminaries, departments or professorships for the
education of young men for ministerial service among the
immigrants from the Northlands. At the Chicago Theological
Seminary (Congregationalist) the Dano-Norwegian
department was organized in 1884, with one professor and
two students; in the following year a Swedish department
was added, the professor being chosen from the Swedish
Free Mission Church. In 1906 these two departments had
each two professors and respectively thirteen and twenty-seven
students, and published a religious paper, <i>Evangelisten</i>.<a id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Besides the Garrett Biblical Institute (Methodist),
Northwestern University has two similar departments,
with thirty-one students in the Swedish, and sixteen in the
Norwegian-Danish section.<a id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> In the Divinity School of the
University of Chicago (Baptist), the same departments
appeared up to 1912; in 1897 there were twenty-two students
in the Dano-Norwegian Department, and thirty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>in the Swedish; for 1905, the corresponding figures were
twenty-four students, with one professor and two instructors,
and thirty-four students, with two professors and one
instructor. Both departments were dropped after 1913.<a id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>So far as the movements represented by these missionary
endeavors and by the organization of schools help to
furnish church privileges to those beyond the reach of
other Protestant churches—since the Catholics are out of
the question—they are admirable, accomplishing much
good. But when they cease to be efforts to extend religious
opportunities, when they are mainly devoted to
swinging men and women already Christian from one
denomination to another, they simply add one more factor
to the inexcusable competition which too often characterizes
the home missionary activity, even when it does not
degenerate into a mere scramble for denominational advantage.
The results in very many cases have been sadly
disproportionate to the expenditures.<a id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Not all the forces, however, have been centrifugal;
the divided body of Lutherans has attempted, with varying
success, to effect permanent union. Since 1890 the centripetal
reaction has been strong, gaining impetus from the
highly significant efforts of the branches of the Norwegian
Lutherans in a synod held in that year in Minneapolis, to
create a single organization. The United Norwegian
Lutheran Church, formed June 13, 1890, was made up of
the Norwegian Augustana Synod, the Norwegian-Danish
Conference, and the Anti-Missourian Brotherhood, thus
becoming the strongest of all the American Norwegian
churches, numbering 1,122 congregations, about 120,000
members, and having property valued at more than $1,500,000.<a id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
But old antagonisms and animosities, generated in
the bitterness of religious controversy, were not easily
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>overcome, and disputes soon arose to disturb the life of
the United Church. The chief of these related to the control
of certain educational institutions, especially Augsburg
Seminary (theological) in Minneapolis. So acute
was the factional quarrel that it was taken into the courts
in 1893, and continued on until 1898, when the “Augsburg
strife” was settled out of court by mutual agreement.
Meantime the Augsburg party had withdrawn from the
United Church, taking some 40,000 members, keeping the
Seminary, worth about $60,000, but giving up to the
United Church the endowment fund of about $40,000.<a id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> In
spite of factions, secessions, and the expulsion of twelve
congregations, the United Church as a whole prospered.
Its annual report for 1905 gave the following statistics:
congregations, more or less closely affiliated, 1,325; ministers
and professors, 453; communicants, 267,000; property,
$715,000.<a id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> While the United Church was the largest,
there were no fewer than four other branches of Norwegian
Lutherans in 1914.<a id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>In contrast with the Norwegians, the Swedes have
manifested a commendable unity in keeping the faith once
delivered to them by the fathers, the chief exception being
the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant, which can
scarcely be called Lutheran. The great Swedish Lutheran
Augustana Synod, one of the constituent members of the
General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, stood staunchly united in the midst of many
changes in other branches of the church. Under the broad
name of the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana
Synod of North America, which comprised both Norwegians
and Swedes down to 1870, it grew rapidly, setting
its face sternly against the New Lutheranism which sought
to modify the old rigidity of doctrine and practice. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>1894 the word Scandinavian was dropped.<a id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> By 1899 the
Synod represented 900 congregations, 200,000 members,
and a material estate of $4,200,000.<a id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The break-up of the Lutheran church is not wholly to
be regretted when viewed in relation to the process of
Americanization, for the church has usually been a stronghold
of traditionalism and conservatism. Perhaps, too, the
vigorous religious and ecclesiastical disputes, wasteful of
energy and of money as they sometimes seem, have contributed
to a wholesome and pervasive intellectual activity
not altogether unlike the results of the Puritan disputations.
So careful a student of Northwestern immigrants
as Mr. O. N. Nelson is inclined to the opinion that the
contentions of the Lutherans may have benefited the
church. “Close observation has convinced us that if there
had been peace instead of war, the Norwegian Lutherans
in the State (Minnesota) would have numbered several
thousand less than they do. It may not seem pious to say
so, but many a worldly-minded Viking has become so
interested in the fight that he has joined the faction with
which he sympathized in order to assist in beating the
opposing party.”<a id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The church services in the great majority of cases are
still conducted in the mother-tongue. In the United Norwegian
Lutheran Church, in 1905, for example, the services
in Norwegian numbered 30,407 as against 1,542 in English,
and out of 1,300 congregations reporting, no more
than six held services in English only, including two large
congregations in Chicago and Milwaukee.<a id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Five other
congregations conducted more services in English than in
Norwegian; in ten localities the numbers were equal; and
in twenty-two, they were about equal, making a total of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>forty-three in which English figured prominently.<a id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The
Hon. N. P. Haugen, speaking on Norway Day at the
World’s Columbian Exposition, in Chicago, commented on
the fact that a Lutheran church had just been dedicated,
in which English alone would be used, and said significantly:
“Twenty years ago our theologians would not
have entertained such a proposition.”<a id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Now the younger
Lutheran preachers are expected to be able to preach both
in their mother-tongue and in English.</p>

<p>The conduct of services in non-English languages will
and should continue so long as there is a considerable body
of men and women who emigrated too late to learn the new
language well enough to stand that final linguistic test,
the power to worship genuinely and satisfyingly in the
adopted speech. This means that the churches will use the
foreign speech until the generation of the foreign-born
ceases to be predominant, and in the cities, perhaps while
the second generation is in the majority; but children who
receive their education in the public schools or other English
speaking schools, will require that their religious
instruction and their devotional exercises be conducted in
English.</p>

<p>The children and grandchildren of the immigrants,
except in certain large and compact settlements, chiefly in
the cities, prefer English, and commonly use that language
in conversation and in correspondence with each other.
In the Swedish and Norwegian wards of such cities as
Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Rockford, and in a
county like Goodhue in Minnesota, where the presence of
large numbers of the foreign-born makes the use of the
foreign tongue imperative in the homes, streets, markets,
and places of business, and where the news is read in a
Scandinavian daily or weekly, the tendency to keep to the
speech of their ancestors is strong. The preacher and the
politician alike understand this, and the literature,
speeches, and even the music, in the campaigns for personal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>and civic righteousness are presented in no unknown
tongue, as the theological seminaries and Scandinavian
departments in other institutions, and the Swedish and
Norwegian political orators in critical years, bear abundant
witness.</p>

<p>Co-ordinate with the school and the church, as a social
force to be estimated, is the press. Newspapers and periodicals
of various sorts in foreign languages inevitably
follow the settlement of any considerable number of aliens
in a given community, for people of education and ambition
will look in a familiar medium for their news and gossip,
their instruction in commerce and politics, as well as their
teaching in religion. So the Chinese and Japanese on the
Pacific Coast, no less than the Germans, Italians, and
Greeks on the Atlantic, have their dailies and their magazines.
Since the three Norse peoples, practically without
illiteracy and with active and ambitious minds, have settled
in a large number of moderate-sized communities,
frequently isolated from each other, and since their differences
of opinion in matters religious and ecclesiastical are
often positive and aggressive, the number of their publications
of all kinds since the middle of the last century is
curiously large, and quite as remarkable for their migratory
and short-lived character.</p>

<p>The newspapers usually serve as the chief means of
keeping informed concerning the general news of the European
home-lands, as well as of the United States. Nearly
all the larger papers publish regular European correspondence,
summaries of events, letters, and clippings,
under such headings as “Sverige,” “Fra Norge,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The newspapers and magazines render another service
by the publication, on the instalment plan, either as a part
of the regular columns or as inserted sheets, of standard
works of the great Scandinavian writers or of translations
of the masterpieces of English and American authors.
Since these novels, essays, and histories are so printed that
they may be folded up and form a pamphlet for preservation,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the periodical serves both as newspaper and library.
“It was the Swedish-American press which caused the
Swedish literature, as it is in America, to spring up.”<a id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>The dailies of Chicago, Minneapolis, and Duluth, in
particular, publish every week scores of communications
from subscribers in all parts of the Northwest, in a department
devoted to neighborhood news or gossip. The
old settler writes his reminiscences, sometimes a brief letter
called out by some event, sometimes at great length,
like the Rev. J. A. Ottesen’s “Contribution to the History
of our Settlements and Congregations,” which ran through
eleven numbers of the weekly paper <i>Amerika</i>, from April
to September of 1894, and gave very minute details of
immigrant families unto the third and fourth generation,
as they had passed under the kindly eye of the patriarchal
old pastor in his service of forty years among them.<a id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
Great numbers of these communications relate to the conditions
and prospects of local settlements as viewed from
the settler’s standpoint—crop conditions, market prices,
wages, opportunities for labor, nature and prices of nearby
land, schools, religion. As a revelation of the real mind
of a community or of an element of the population, showing
the inducements and motives operating upon the
immigrant, and his response, they are exceedingly valuable,
and in some important respects almost unique.</p>

<p>The editors and business agents of the larger and
more enterprising Scandinavian papers very early began
making journeys about the country, especially into the
newer parts, in the interests of their papers; incidentally
they were spying out the land for themselves, but indirectly
they were furnishing first-hand observations of
frontier conditions to the hundreds who were moved to reinvest
themselves and their small accumulations. One of
these “circuit riders” was Johan Schröder, editor of
<i>Fædrelandet og Emigranten</i>, founded at La Crosse, in
1864, who published a little book of information for immigrants
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>in 1867, after one of his extensive journeys among
the settlements.<a id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Three years later he made a trip into
Minnesota as far as Otter Tail County—“En Snartur i
Nordvesten”—and was deeply impressed with the possibilities
of that fertile section, to which many men of his
nationality were already looking, as the Newtown folk in
Massachusetts Bay looked in 1636 toward the Connecticut
country, with a “strong bent of their spirits to move
thither.” Such words as these were as seed sown in good
soil: “So far as I have journeyed about in the prairie
counties of Minnesota and Iowa, I have not yet met with
any county which in multiplicity of natural resources can
come up with Otter Tail. Immigration this year is very
strong. Both newcomers direct from Norway, and older
farmers from Iowa, Wisconsin and Southern Minnesota
take their various ways thither.”<a id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The “America fever”
of the Old World was now the “West fever,” and again
more of the “West fever.”<a id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> These articles were not mere
generalizations, but often, as in those just quoted from,
they gave the exact and practical information the reader
would desire—break-up of the prairie would cost $25 or
$30 for five acres on which to grow wheat and potatoes,
cash to be had by working on the nearby railroad at $2.50
per day, salt to be had at five cents per pound, butter could
be sold for ten cents per pound, fish and game were abundant,—also
mosquitoes!<a id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The first of a long line of Swedish, Norwegian, and
Danish periodicals in the west, was a little paper called
<i>Nordlyset</i> (Northern Light), which began publication in
the Norwegian colony in Racine county, Wisconsin, in
1847, with James D. Reymert as editor. It was a small
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>four-page sheet which at the start espoused the cause of
the Free Soil party. In 1850 it changed hands, and was
re-christened <i>Demokraten</i>; tho its subscription list increased
to three hundred, the venture proved a failure.<a id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>After 1850 the number of Scandinavian newspapers
and religious periodicals multiplied rapidly. Langeland,
himself an editor and publisher of the time, mentions five
of these publications on the Norwegian side alone in the
decade following 1850.<a id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> <i>Skandinaven</i>, whose foundation
marks an era in the Scandinavian press, dates back to this
period. From its small beginnings has grown a great
metropolitan daily, with a circulation of 20,000, besides its
semi-weekly and weekly editions which have a circulation
all over the Northwest of nearly 50,000.<a id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> In the ten years
after 1870, a second expansion in the number of publications
took place, tho the fifteen Scandinavian papers given
in the list published in the standard newspaper directory
for 1870, make an almost insignificant showing by the side
of the two hundred and fifty or more printed in America
in German.<a id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>The Swedish press in the United States began somewhat
later than the Norwegian, but it manifested a stability
and steadiness of progress which the latter too often
lacked. <i>Hemlandet</i> was founded in 1855 as an organ of
Swedish Lutheranism, but in 1870 it was a political as
well as a religious journal, with 4,000 subscribers to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>weekly edition, and 2,000 to the monthly,—“the largest
circulation of any Swedish political newspaper in this
country.”<a id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The high-water mark in the number of these publications
in the Northern tongues seems to have been in 1892
or 1893, when Rowell mentions 146, of which Minnesota
is credited with 33, Illinois with 30, Iowa with 13, and
Wisconsin with 10, a total for these four States of 86, with
a reported total of 140,000 subscribers, out of 550,000
subscribers for all the Scandinavian papers in the country.
By 1901, the number of papers had fallen off—many suspended
in the hard times after 1893<a id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>—but the number of
subscribers increased for the whole country to more than
800,000, and for the four States just enumerated, to more
than 650,000.<a id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>The politics and religion of the papers reflected the
variegated opinions of different parties and sects, and of
men who would found new parties and denominations, but
Lutheranism and Republicanism have been from the start
the dominating influences. A historian of Lutheranism
named 16 Swedish Evangelical Lutheran periodicals in
existence in the United States in 1896.<a id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> About the same
time a Democratic paper remarks grudgingly and sourly:
“It is worthy of note that of the fifty or sixty Norwegian
papers in the United States, including two dailies, all are
Republican tho at rare intervals some may bolt individual
nominations. Generally, however, they are amazingly
steadfast to party—moss-backed and hide-bound, in fact.”<a id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>The strong hold which this press exercises upon its
subscribers is excellently illustrated in the large sums of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>money raised from time to time through its agency in
behalf of sufferers from fire and famine in the North European
peninsulas. By editorials and special correspondence,
by subscriptions and the publications of lists of contributors,
by stimulating concerts for raising relief
moneys, these journals have pursued the shrewd, enterprising,
and, at the same time, benevolent schemes of advertising,
followed by their American contemporaries. In
1893 <i>Skandinaven</i> received and remitted to Norway for
the relief of sufferers from a landslide in Thelemark more
than $2,700.<a id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> When a great fire nearly destroyed the city
of Aalesund, that journal in the winter and spring of 1904
gathered and sent to Norway $19,000, mostly in sums
ranging from $.25 to $2.00; at the same time <i>Decorah
Posten</i> remitted more than $12,000 for the same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
The great famine in northern Sweden and Finland in
1902-3 gave rise to a similar collection of money; the editor
of the <i>Svenska Amerikanska Posten</i>, the powerful Swedish
newspaper of Minneapolis, headed the list for his paper,
and at the end of several months the contributions through
this one journal reached the total of approximately $18,000.<a id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
Of course not all the money so liberally poured out
to aid the unfortunate by the Baltic or the North Sea, was
transmitted through the agents of the newspapers, but it
is true that almost the sole inspiration for the gifts came
more or less directly from the Scandinavian press. Probably
out of $175,000 sent from the United States to the
famine sufferers in 1903,—and America’s quota was about
one-half of the total handled by the Swedish central committee
in Stockholm—the newspapers were instrumental
in raising fifty per-cent.<a id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">Social Relations and Characteristics</p>


<p>While the normal unit in Scandinavian immigration
is the family, a considerable proportion of the immigrants
has consisted of young, unmarried men and women. Not
infrequently the young man left behind him a sweetheart
who followed a little later when a solid foundation was laid
for the prospective family; or perchance, if sufficiently
prosperous, he went back at some Christmastide to marry
her and bring her to America. In any case, the farm meant
a home, and the marriage back of it was generally between
two of the same nationality. Still, intermarriages between
Scandinavians and persons of American or of other alien
stock, are not infrequent, tho the number and significance
of such marriages is more a matter of personal
opinion and estimate than of exact statistics, since the
latter are lacking. The opinions expressed in this chapter
are based upon the inconclusive figures of the census
reports, upon a study of a large number of brief
biographies, and upon a considerable acquaintance with
conditions in the Northwest. The biographies, it should
be noted, are almost exclusively of men of Scandinavian
birth, whose intermarriage with American women is less
common than that of American men with Scandinavian
women.<a id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Before the flood tide of immigration in the period
beginning about 1880 brought to America so many young,
unmarried women, intermarriages were more infrequent
than in the later time. Hence the discussion of the matter
in the Census Report of 1880 would not necessarily hold
true for the subsequent period: “There is but one important
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>element (other than the Irish) which manifests
an equally strong indisposition to intermarriage, viz., the
Scandinavian. This element appears in an important
degree in but few of the States and Territories embraced
in the following tables, but in these the effects of intermarriage
are slight. Thus in Wisconsin, while there are
42,728 persons born on our soil having both Scandinavian
father and Scandinavian mother, there are but 2,083 persons
having a Scandinavian father and an American
mother. In Dakota, the respective numbers are 10,071
and 418; in Minnesota 69,492 and 1,906.... It will be
noted that in some of the States and Territories where the
Scandinavians are few and where it is notorious that they
are thoroly mingled with the general population, the proportion
of intermarriages is not a low one.”<a id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The figures
for the children of such mixed marriages given in the
reports of the Twelfth Census certainly reveal a decided
increase in the number, especially when the necessary
allowance is made for the decreasing birthrate naturally
incident to the development of urban communities and to
filling up of States, which took place between 1880 and
1900.<a id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>In these two decades, large numbers of young unmarried
women, moved by the same economic motives as
the young men, came to the United States and took service
among the Americans as domestic servants. The demand
for capable and well-trained servants far exceeded,
and still exceeds, the visible supply, and the wages which
seemed high to the American housewife seemed trebly high
to the girl who received in cash wages in the old home
only $20 or $30 per year.<a id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In the new service the girls
must perforce learn English rapidly or fail, so they learned
the language and also the ways of the American household.
In return they gave an honest, good-tempered, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>trustworthy if sometimes clumsy service. If they were
not always evidently grateful for the instruction and
patience of the mistress of the household, if frequently
they married soon after they were trained into efficient
and satisfactory servants, they should not be condemned
wholesale! While the marriages of these strong, healthy,
intelligent, domestically capable young women with non-Scandinavian
young men of the middle and lower classes
constitute the larger proportion of intermarriages, the
intermarriage of the American-born Scandinavian girls,
trained in the public schools and colleges, with American
men is also frequent, and no reservation as to the mixture
of social classes needs to be made.</p>

<p>Large families have been a prominent characteristic of
the home life of the Northmen in America’s Northwest.
Race suicide should not be charged against the Scandinavians
either in their new homes or in their old, for in
spite of the steady drain which emigration has made upon
the population of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark for fifty
years, each country in each decade has shown an increase
of population, due solely to natural increase.<a id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In America
this natural fecundity was re-enforced by the conditions
under which settlement was made, for large families are
characteristic of the early years of a developing agricultural
frontier. So when the Scandinavians entered the
newly-opened regions of the Great West and found land
and food abundant, both immediately and prospectively,
they felt no necessity for enforcing prudential or other
checks upon the increase of population. Putting the case
more positively, circumstances put a premium upon families
with numerous children; the farmer welcomed additions
to his circle of boys and girls who would grow up
into helpers upon the expanding cultivated acreage of the
farm, and later take up land near the original homestead,
buttressing it with prosperous allied homes. Families of
ten and twelve were common, while others reached sixteen,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>eighteen, and even twenty-four.<a id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> In his remarkably detailed
reminiscences of Norwegian settlers in Wisconsin
and the further Northwest, the Rev. J. A. Ottesen refers
to families of his friends and acquaintances, sometimes in
exact figures, as seven, ten, or fourteen children, and
sometimes in such general phrases as “many children,” or
“several children,” making use of these phrases no less
than seventeen times in three columns of a single article.<a id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>An examination of several thousand biographical
sketches of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes who have attained
some degree of success in the American West, the
very class which would first begin to limit the size of the
family, leads to the conclusion that the average number
of children per family among them is between four and
five. In other words the average is nearly double that of
the United States taken as a whole.<a id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Closely connected with this immigration of so many
young, unmarried girls of the servant class, is the question
of sex morality and illegitimacy. The statistics relating
to this question are particularly unsatisfactory so far as
the United States is concerned, even for a land where the
scientific statistician is a recent product, and where the
collection of social statistics, left mainly to the States and
to local authorities, is very loosely carried on. The motives
for concealment and for prevarication are obvious,
and the records of municipal courts, even if closely inspected,
would not give much more than a scant minimum
of information applicable to an estimate of the Scandinavian
element in the population.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>To judge from the figures given for certain cities in
Norway and Sweden, it would be natural to expect a much
higher percentage of illegitimate births among the immigrants
from those countries than among persons of American
ancestry. The United States Consul at Stockholm
reported for 1884 for the whole of Sweden that 10.2% of
all births were illegitimate; for the city of Stockholm
alone, 29.3%.<a id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Twelve years later the figure for the
whole kingdom was 11%.<a id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> For Norway, the figure for
the kingdom was 7.2% for 1896; in the city of Christiania,
15.4% of the 5,349 births in 1895 were illegitimate.<a id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Such statistics are certainly ominous, whatever the
allowance which should be made for peculiar social conditions
in Europe, which make the begetting of children
after betrothal and before actual wedlock a less heinous
offence against good order and morality than in America.
But over against these startling figures stands the fact
that it does not seem to be harder to maintain order and
decency in cities like Minneapolis and St. Paul, or in the
Scandinavian wards of Chicago, than it is in Detroit or
Boston, or in the other alien quarters of Chicago itself.
Nor does an inspection of the court and police records of
cities of the Northwest for crimes and offences against
decency, or against women, give cause for any special
alarm for the future morality of the Scandinavians of
that section.</p>

<p>For a safe and conclusive estimate of the contributions
made by the Scandinavian element to the delinquent
and defective classes of society, no very complete or satisfactory
data are at present to be had. A detailed study
of the statistics of these classes in Wisconsin and Minnesota
warrants the judgment that the immigrants from
Northern Europe, and their immediate descendants, have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>a much smaller percentage of paupers and criminals and
a much larger percentage of insane, than do either the
Germans or the Irish, the two other alien elements which
approach the Scandinavians in importance in those
States.<a id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> But these statistics are at best unconvincing,
because they are acknowledgedly incomplete, and because
in them little attempt is made to distinguish between the
children of American descent and those born of immigrant
parents in America.</p>

<p>The experts working out the interpretation of the
results of the Twelfth Census (1900) have made distinct
progress towards a fair comparative judgment in matters
relating to social classes and conditions. John Koren, for
example, the son of the veteran Norwegian Lutheran pastor,
the Rev. V. Koren, and an investigator and writer of
unusual weight, points out that the insane in hospitals
are at least ten years of age, while there are few children
under fifteen among the immigrants as compared with the
number under that age among the native whites, and he
accordingly concludes that “Of the whites at least 10
years of age in the general population of the United States
in 1900, 80.5% were native and 19.5% were foreign-born;
while of the white insane of known nativity enumerated
in hospitals on December 31, 1903, 65.7% were native and
34.3% were foreign-born. Relatively, therefore, the insane
are more numerous among the foreign born whites than
among the native.”<a id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> How much more convincing is such
a cautious and careful estimate than the sweeping generalizations
of another recent writer: “Roughly speaking, the
foreigners furnish more than twice as many criminals, two
and one-third times as many insane, and three times as
many paupers as the native element.”<a id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The statistics for the insane in hospitals at the end
of 1903 and of those admitted during 1904, as given by
Mr. Koren, show a strikingly high percentage of insane
persons of foreign parentage in Wisconsin, Minnesota,
North Dakota, and Iowa. No other State comes within
ten per-cent of the ratio of the first three. Of those enumerated
in December, 1903, 56% in Wisconsin, 48% in
Minnesota, 52% in North Dakota, and 34% in Iowa, were
of foreign parentage; the percentages of the admissions
for 1904 were 53% in Wisconsin, 55% in Minnesota, and
33% in Iowa.<a id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> In all these States the Scandinavian element
has been numerous for at least two generations.
Figures gathered for this study for the period between
1885 and 1895, before the children of the Scandinavian
immigrants reached in very considerable numbers what
might be termed the age for acquiring insanity, gave similarly
significant conclusions. Of the inmates of the state
hospitals for the insane in Minnesota, the foreign-born
Scandinavians were 28% in 1886 and 30.7% in 1890; of
the admissions to the state hospital at St. Peter in 1890,
35% were Norse. Of the total admissions for the State in
1900, 23% were Scandinavians, while in the Fergus Falls
hospital, located in the heart of a more recently settled
Scandinavian area, 40% were of that nationality; Wisconsin
reports show like percentages.<a id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> All of these statistics
warrant the general conclusion that of all the foreign-born,
the Scandinavians are the most prone to insanity.<a id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>If one seeks for adequate reasons for this unusual
tendency to insanity, he will not find ready satisfaction.
Undoubtedly the difference of environment and the severer
strain upon muscle and nerve imposed by American industrial
conditions, by which the machinery of the individual
must run at a higher and unwonted speed, will account
for part of the phenomena, but these causes operate alike
upon all classes of immigrants. The change from the
mountains of Norway, or from the rugged sea-coast of the
great Northern peninsula, to the rolling prairies and the
vast silent plains of the interior of the United States, has
also its depressing effect. The very flatness of the land,
its extremes of temperature, the fierce tornadoes of wind,
the bewildering, imprisoning storms of snow, with no
friendly mountain or forest to offer a body of protection
or a face of comfort, and the isolation of the life of the
frontier farmer and his family, together with the severity
of their labor—all these are causes operating with peculiar
force in the case of the Norwegian and Swedish immigrants.
Dr. Gronvald, writing in 1887, stated his conviction
that the women of these classes, especially the Norwegians,
were predisposed to nervous disorders and insanity
by early and frequent child-bearing, and from early
rising from child-bed.<a id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Since the Norse immigrants have rarely if ever been
charged with illiteracy, dependency, pauperism or mendicancy,
the remaining social test, usually considered co-ordinate
with that for insanity, is the proportion of criminals
contributed to the total of delinquents.<a id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Earlier
computations must undergo the same severe correction as
do the estimates regarding the insane. By 1885 there were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>in the Northwest large communities made up of the older
Norwegian and Swedish settlers and their descendants,
and other communities comprising great numbers of recently
arrived immigrants. According to the State census
of 1885 in Minnesota, the Scandinavians formed 16.5% of
the population, and the Germans, 11.5%. The reports of
the wardens of the State’s prisons for 1886 show 8.7% of
the prisoners to be Scandinavian, and 7.4% German. The
population of the State during the next five years grew
rapidly; the Scandinavian element increased faster than
the German and nearly twice as fast as the native American.
Yet in 1890 the percentage of the prisoners who
could be identified as Scandinavian was only 7.1%.<a id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>In Wisconsin, where the increase of population in the
last ten years of the nineteenth century was in the native-born
of Scandinavian parentage, rather than in the number
of immigrants, the reports of the Waupun State
Prison may be supplemented by those of the State Industrial
School, the reformatory for first offenders between
the ages of fifteen and thirty. In 1900, the foreign-born
Scandinavian population of Wisconsin was 5% of the
total, and the Scandinavian population of foreign-born
parentage was 10% of the total.<a id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Of the prisoners received
at Waupun, the Scandinavians were: 1891, 4.1%;
1898, 4.4%; 1900, 3.7%. Of boys and young men received
at the Industrial School, those of Scandinavian parentage
were: 1890-1892, 7%; 1896-1898, 6.5%; 1900-1902, 6.6%.<a id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of petty offences which are usually tried
in the police courts, particularly cases arising out of
intemperance, the records of convictions in Minneapolis,
St. Paul, and Chicago, together with the statistics of city
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>prisons and workhouses, indicate that the Northmen are
clearly the chief offenders.<a id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">The Scandinavian in Local and State Politics</p>


<p>The Scandinavian usually entered the field of politics
rather slowly; he took out his “first papers” for the purpose
of acquiring land, not that he might vote in the next
election. In the early years of his settlement he was too
busy building and paying for a home, learning English,
and adopting American customs, to give much time or
attention to public affairs. The clearing of woodland, the
breaking up of the prairie, and the transformation of a
one-room shack into a frame dwelling required severe labor
and all his energies. Not until the leisure of some degree
of success was his, did he yield to his natural inclination
for politics of the larger sort.</p>

<p>The Norwegian, of all the men of the Northern lands,
has the strongest liking for the political arena, and has
had the most thoro political training at home. Since 1814
he has lived and acted in a community markedly democratic.
He understands the meaning of the Fourth of
July all the better because he, and his ancestors for two
or three generations in their home by the North Sea, celebrated
on the Seventeenth of May the independence of
Norway and the advent of republicanism. His sense of
individuality and equality is stronger than that of his
cousins to the east or south, and he steadily and stubbornly
fights for the recognition and maintenance of his rights.
In 1821, before the first real immigrants sailed for the
United States, Norway abolished nobility, while Sweden
and Denmark still retain the institution. Equipped thus,
and educated in such a vigorous school, it is the Norwegian
rather than the Swede or Dane who figures most
largely in the political activities of the American Northwest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Several causes operating on the western side of the
Atlantic augmented these natural advantages of the Norwegians.
In their settlements they had ten or fifteen
years the start of the Swedes, and in the formative period
of Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Dakota they greatly
outnumbered both the Swedes and Danes. They went
into new States and territories, and, settling on farms,
profited by the power which the rural portion of a developing
region usually exercises in politics. On the other
hand, tho the Swedes in Illinois since the early fifties,
and in Kansas since the late sixties, have formed decidedly
the larger part of the Scandinavian population of
those two States, they have by no means taken a part in
politics equal to that taken by the Norwegians. In 1890
the foreign-born Swedes in Iowa were more numerous
than the foreign-born Norwegians, and in Minnesota about
equal in number, but these figures do not fairly represent
the political strength of the two elements, for to the foreign-born
Norwegians must be added those of the second
and third generation of persons of purely Norwegian extraction.<a id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
The sons, and even the grandsons of the early
Norwegian settlers were voters before the Swedish immigration
greatly exceeded the Norwegian.<a id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Broadly speaking,
the early political pre-eminence of the Norwegians
has never been overcome.</p>

<p>For the common people of Sweden and Denmark,
political experience practically began with the agitation
for the reforms of 1866 and 1867. The peasants and
burghers thus came to think definitely and decisively
about what they desired and of the means for securing the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>wished-for reforms. It may therefore be asserted without
reservation that after 1870 the average Scandinavian immigrant
brought to America a fairly clear understanding
of the meaning of republicanism; elections, representation,
local self-government, and constitutions, are neither
novel nor meaningless terms to him; he is ready to fill his
place, play his part, and cast his vote, as “a citizen of no
mean city.” In the discharge of their civic duties, the
Scandinavian voters have had the aid of several unusually
well edited newspapers in their own languages. Since
active participation in politics and patriotism are not
always synonymous, one branch of the Scandinavian peoples
may be just as patriotic as another. Certain it is
that in the Civil War the Swedes were every whit as
prompt and hearty in their response to calls for men, and
as thoro in their efficiency and courage as soldiers, as
were the Norwegians.</p>

<p>From a political view-point, the importance of the
Norse immigrants in the agricultural regions of the West
has not been fully recognized. At first thought, it would
seem that location in a city or town, with its intimate
associations and sharper competitions, with its friction of
frequent contact with Americans, should be more conducive
to rapid Americanization of immigrants, than the
life of the farm or of the rural village, with its isolation
and narrow horizon. More careful consideration will make
clear that the opportunities for political action beyond
merely casting a vote, are really much better in a new,
thinly-settled township than in a ward of a large town or
city. It surely was not a hunger for the sweets of political
influence or official place which led the Scandinavians into
frontier regions; but once there, with the old political ties
forever severed by taking out their “first papers,” with
partial title to land entered by preemption or by homesteading,
their first and greatest steps in Americanization
were safely made, and each one carried certain political
consequences. Local political organization had to be effected
somehow as a given locality filled up, and it happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
frequently that there were none but Scandinavians
to undertake the task. No matter what their political
inclinations, no matter what form of organization they
would have preferred, only one course was open to them:
to get information as to the laws and customs of the
United States and of the States in which they were settled,
to prepare for the elections, and to assume the responsibilities
of the necessary offices. Over and over
again these things were done promptly and well by men
in whose veins coursed only Viking blood, by men but
recently transplanted from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>

<p>Whenever a township became populous enough to
have a name as well as a number on the surveyor’s map,
that question was likely to be determined by the people
on the ground, and such names as Christiana, Swede Plain,
Numedal, Throndhjem, and Vasa leave no doubt that
Scandinavians officiated at the christening.<a id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Besides the
names of townships, Minnesota alone has no fewer than
seventy-five post-offices whose names are unmistakably
Norse,—Malmö, Ringbo, Ibsen, Tordenskjold, and the like.
It was in organizing these new townships, working the
town machinery, carrying on elections, levying and collecting
taxes, and laying out roads, that the Scandinavian
immigrants learned the rudiments of American politics.<a id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
In studying the accounts of the formation of scores of
towns inhabited wholly or in major part by Norwegians
or Swedes—accounts usually written by Americans, and
often going into minute details—not one was found which
describes any noteworthy irregularity. Except for the
peculiar names no one would suspect that the townmakers
were born elsewhere than in Massachusetts or New York.</p>

<p>In some cases probably more than one-fifth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>men of the community shared in the actual administration
of town affairs; and while this ratio decreased with the
growth of the town, the tendency of the Scandinavian settlers
to move on from one new region to another gave
many of them continuing opportunities to gain political
experience. Had the same number of men located in the
larger towns or cities, their active duties as citizens would
generally have ended with the casting of their annual ballot.
A few might have become policemen, commissioners,
or even aldermen, but they would have made an insignificant
percentage; the management or mismanagement of
finances, schools, streets, sanitation, and public services
would go on without their efforts or participation.</p>

<p>A few illustrations selected almost at random, will
give a concrete idea of the process just described. Two
townships in Fillmore County, Minnesota, were organized
in 1860, and received the familiar Old World names, Norway
and Arendahl; at the first election, all the officers
chosen in both townships were Norwegians, and for
twenty years and more, the Norwegians continued to fill
nearly all the offices.<a id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Another and later example is
found in Nicollet County, Minnesota, farther west than
Fillmore County, where the township of New Sweden was
formed in 1864. Thirty votes were cast at the first election,
and at the first town-meeting, held three months
later, all the offices were filled by the election of six
Swedes and four Norwegians.<a id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Five years later this
township was divided and the name Bernadotte was given
to the new township; by the first election, all ten offices
were filled by Swedes.<a id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Other Minnesota towns, Johnsonville
in Redwood County (1879), Wang in Renville County
(1875), and Stockholm in Wright County (1868), were
similarly organized and officered by Norwegians and
Swedes.<a id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>As the townships developed, and the villages grew
into cities with large foreign-born elements, the familiar
and characteristic Northern names continue to fill the
official records. Stoughton, Wisconsin, the capital, so to
speak, of the solid old Dane County settlement, is a case
in point. So late as 1901 the roster of the city ran as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mayor, O. K. Roe, born in Dane County of Norwegian
parents</p>

<p>President of the Council, J. S. Liebe, born in Laurvik,
Norway</p>

<p>Aldermen, four born in different parts of Norway, two
born in Dane County of Norwegian parents.<a id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Much of the business in these new communities in
their first years was carried on in a foreign tongue. Certainly
election notices and documents of that sort were
issued in Norwegian or Swedish, and sometimes orders,
ordinances, and laws. No evidence, however, has come to
hand to prove that any official records were ever kept in
any other language than English, even in villages composed
almost exclusively of Norwegians or Swedes.<a id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>One of the first offices that had to be filled in the
growing settlement was that of postmaster; for no considerable
number of people, educated and intelligent, will
long be content with a postoffice twenty miles away.<a id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> In
1856 there were five Scandinavian postmasters in Minnesota
alone.<a id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Thus the immigrant settlers came in contact
with the national government at the postoffice more directly
and frequently than they did at the land-office.</p>

<p>Township affairs shade off almost imperceptibly into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>county affairs in the western States, and the Scandinavians
soon began to take part in the latter. No records
are at hand for the Wisconsin settlements, but in 1858 the
first Norwegian was elected to the board of supervisors in
Goodhue County, Minnesota, and in the following year
Hans Mattson, who was active in building up the town of
Vasa, where he filled various town offices, was elected
auditor of the county.<a id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> He continued to fill the office
until July, 1862, tho in name only for the last months,
for in the minutes of Board of Supervisors of Goodhue
County appears the resolution that “because the County
Auditor, Hans Mattson, has voluntarily gone to the war
with a company of soldiers, a leave of absence shall be
extended to him, and that the office shall not be declared
vacant so long as the deputy properly performs the duties
of the place.”<a id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Hans Mattson was only one of many who found Goodhue
County politics and a term of service in the army
excellent fitting schools for larger activity in State affairs.
One of the Norwegians who served an apprenticeship in
Wisconsin, a journeymanship in Iowa, and came to the
master-grade of citizenship—office-holding—in Minnesota,
was Lars K. Aaker, who represented Goodhue County in
the Minnesota Legislature in 1859-1860. After service as
first lieutenant in Mattson’s Scandinavian Company, he
again sat in the Legislature in 1862, 1867, and 1869.
Again after twelve years of residence in Goodhue County
he moved to Otter Tail County, and represented that
county in the State Senate, later becoming Register of
the United States Land Office. In 1864, he moved again,
to Crookston, in the extreme northwestern corner of Minnesota,
where he served as Receiver of the Land Office
from 1884 to 1893.<a id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> As the counties and towns have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>multiplied, by the biological process of division, in Minnesota
and the Dakotas, Scandinavian names recur more
and more frequently in their records, tho it is not always
easy, especially since 1880, to identify such names, for the
Norsemen have had a habit of Americanizing their original
names or changing them altogether either with or without
legal process.<a id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>The county offices which seem to be most attractive
to the Scandinavians are those of sheriff, treasurer, auditor,
and register of deeds. The lists of county officers for
several years in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas,
show that the number of Swedes and Norwegians in the
four offices just mentioned was closely proportioned to
their percentage in the population of the States named.<a id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
Because the Scandinavians are less numerous in the other
county offices, their proportion of the total offices in the
counties of the States falls considerably below their proportion
of the population. Estimating on the basis of a
sure minimum, with the difficulties in identifying names
eliminated, the Scandinavians for several years about 1895
filled approximately one-fifth of the 1235 county offices
in Minnesota, one-fifth of the 268 in North Dakota and
one-tenth of the 702 in Wisconsin. Their numbers relative
to the population in each State were respectively one-fourth
in Minnesota, two-fifths in North Dakota, one-eighth
in Wisconsin, and one-fifth in South Dakota. More
recent illustrations are to be found in the election of 1904.
In Traill County, North Dakota, the sixth in size of the
forty counties in the State, the sheriff, judge, treasurer,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>auditor, register, surveyor, coroner, and superintendent of
schools were of Scandinavian origin; in Lac Qui Parle
County, Minnesota, a similar clean sweep was made;
while in Yellow Medicine County seven out of ten principal
officers were Scandinavians.<a id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>The first Scandinavian to enter the field of State politics
was James D. Reymert, a Norwegian, who represented
Racine County in the second constitutional convention of
Wisconsin in 1847, and later in the Assembly of that State,
first from Racine County and then from Milwaukee County
in 1857.<a id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> He was also a candidate for presidential elector
on the Free Soil ticket in 1840.<a id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The son of a Scotch
mother, and receiving part of his education in Scotland,
he was better prepared than other Norwegians for taking
part in politics, and for the work of editing the first Norwegian
newspaper in America, <i>Nordlyset</i>—“The Northern
Light”—which appeared in 1847 as a Free Soil organ.<a id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
In the constitutional convention he was not active in the
debates, tho he advocated a six-months’ residence as a
qualification for voting, saying, “as to foreigners, the
sooner they were entitled to vote, the better citizens they
would make.”<a id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> For one provision of the Wisconsin constitution
he was personally responsible: Article VII, section
16, which directed the legislature to establish courts
or tribunals of conciliation.<a id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> But in spite of the command,
“The legislature shall pass laws” for these courts,
no such law was ever passed in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Down to the close of the Civil War the Scandinavians
exercised very little influence in State politics. Here and
there one or two of them appeared as members of conventions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>or of the legislatures, but even in Wisconsin the
number rarely went above two in a single session of the
legislature.<a id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> By 1870 many of the Norwegians and
Swedes were well-to-do, while others who had served in
the Civil War returned to their homes with the prestige
conferred by honorable service in that great struggle.
Furthermore, the suspicion with which foreign-born citizens
had been viewed was greatly reduced, if not dissipated,
by the highest evidence which any man can give of
his patriotism and loyalty to his adopted country. No one
might thenceforth deny them any of the rights, privileges,
and honors of the political gild. Accordingly the number
of them elected to the legislatures in the Northwest after
1870 increases noticeably both in Wisconsin and Minnesota,
and in the Dakotas, where rapid material development
and growth of population furnished unusual political
opportunities which the Norwegians and Swedes were not
slow to improve.</p>

<p>In the Wisconsin legislature of 1868 sat 2 Norwegians;
in 1869, 3; in 1871, 4.<a id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> In Minnesota, the figures
are striking: 1868, 2 Scandinavians; 1870, 4; 1872, 9;
and 1873, 13.<a id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Since then the percentage of Norse representatives
has steadily grown, tho it is not always easy to
determine the racial stock from which a native-born officer
came. Recent Wisconsin legislatures had apparently out
of a total membership of 133, in 1895, 5 Scandinavians;
in 1901, 10 (1 Dane, 1 Swede, and 8 Norwegians); in 1903,
6.<a id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The Minnesota legislature of 1893 had 9 out of 54
senators, and 20 out of 114 representatives, who were of
Viking origin—fully one-sixth of the total membership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>In the legislatures of 1899 and 1905 the numbers were as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>In the newer States to the West, the percentages rise
still higher. In North Dakota, the legislature of 93 members
contained 17 men of Scandinavian parentage in 1895,
and 18 in 1901—16 Norwegians (4 American born), one
Dane, and one Icelander.<a id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Unofficial figures for 1904
gave the Scandinavians 38 out of 140 members.<a id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> South
Dakota in 1894 had 15 Norwegians (5 native-born) and 5
Swedes, in a legislative body of 127; in 1897, 17; in 1903,
16; and in 1904, 17.<a id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>In the executive and administrative departments of
State government, as distinguished from the legislative,
the participation of the Scandinavians notably increased
after 1869. In the summer of that year, a Scandinavian
convention was held in Minneapolis for the express purpose
of booming Colonel Hans Mattson for the office of
Secretary of State in Minnesota. Of his fitness there was
no doubt, for in addition to holding local offices in Goodhue
County and his service in the army, he had for two
years served as Commissioner of Emigration. The Republicans
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>took the hint and nominated him almost unanimously
in September, and his election followed. He
served one term at this time and by re-elections filled the
same office from 1887 to 1891.<a id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> So frequently have
Swedes and Norwegians been elected to this office both in
Minnesota and in the Dakotas that it might almost be said
that they have a prescriptive right to it.<a id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> In the thirty-seven
years ending in January, 1907, the Swedes filled the
office in Minnesota sixteen years and the Norwegians four
years.<a id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Other State offices like those of Treasurer, Auditor,
and Lieutenant Governor, not to mention commissionerships
and appointments to boards, have also been frequently
filled by Scandinavians in the States of the Northwest.<a id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The first Scandinavian to reach the eminence of a
governorship was Knute Nelson, an emigrant from Voss,
near Bergen in Norway, in 1849, who, after service in the
Civil War, was elected in succession to the legislatures of
Wisconsin and Minnesota and to the Congress of the
United States. Nominated by acclamation for governor
of Minnesota on the Republican ticket in 1892, he was
elected by a plurality of 14,620 votes; two years later he
was unanimously re-nominated, and re-elected by a plurality
of more than 60,000 votes.<a id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> He served only one
month of his second term, accepting election to the United
States Senate, to the disappointment, not to say the disgust,
of many who had voted for him for Governor, who
considered him in duty bound to serve in that capacity
after accepting their suffrages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>The second Scandinavian governor was a Swede born
in Smaaland, who landed in the United States in 1868 at
the age of fourteen—John Lind. Passing up through such
political gradations as county superintendent of schools,
receiver of the United States Land Office, and Republican
representative in Congress, he allied himself with the free-silver
movement of 1896 and became the Fusion candidate
for governor of Minnesota. Opposed by the leading Swedes
who remained loyal to the Republican party, he was defeated
by a small majority, tho supported by many of the
Norwegians. The Spanish War, in which he served as
quartermaster of volunteers, gave him a new claim to
popular favor, and when he again ran for governor in 1898
he was elected by a combination of Democrats and Populists,
turning his former deficiency of 3,496 into a plurality
of 20,399.<a id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> This victory was due more to a revolt against
the Republican candidate than to clannish support of a
Swede by Swedes, for the two strongholds of the Swedes,
Chisago and Goodhue Counties, went Republican as usual,
while the German and Irish wards of St. Paul and Minneapolis
gave majorities for Lind.</p>

<p>The third of Minnesota’s Scandinavian governors
came into office under circumstances of distinctly dramatic
character. John A. Johnson was born of Swedish parents
in the State over which he was to be made ruler; at the age
of fourteen he became the support of his mother and of the
family, save the inebriate father who was sent to an almshouse
where he died. When nominated by the Democrats
in 1904, Johnson had been for eighteen years editor of a
country newspaper printed in English. The Republicans,
especially their candidate for governor, a coarse-grained,
distrusted, machine politician, endeavored to make political
capital out of the fact that Johnson’s father died in the
poorhouse. The Democratic leaders persuaded Johnson
with some difficulty to let the plain truth be told, and told
on the stump—and Johnson, the son of a Swedish immigrant,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>a man from a small, interior city, a Democrat in a
State strongly Republican as a rule, won by a plurality of
6,352 votes in a Presidential year, when Theodore Roosevelt
carried the State by 161,464.<a id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Two years of vigorous
but quiet administration brought the reward of a renomination
and re-election in 1906 by a plurality of 76,000.<a id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Again in 1908, another presidential year, Governor Johnson
was re-elected by 20,000 plurality, though Taft received
a plurality of 85,000.<a id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The death of Governor Johnson in October, 1909, made
the Republican Lieutenant Governor, Adolph Olson Eberhardt,
the fourth Scandinavian executive of Minnesota. He
was born in Sweden, the son of Andrew Olson, and came
to America in his eleventh year. He added Eberhardt to
his name by permission of the proper court in 1898 because
several other persons in his community also bore the
name of Adolph Olson. Governor Eberhardt reached the
governor’s chair by various business and political experiences—as
a lawyer, contractor, United States Commissioner,
deputy clerk of the United States District and Circuit
Courts, State senator, and lieutenant governor. He
was re-elected in his own right in 1910 by a plurality of
60,000, and again in 1912 by 30,000.<a id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>James O. Davidson rose to the governorship of Wisconsin
through long service in subordinate capacities. Of
Norwegian birth, immigrating in 1872, he was elected to
the Wisconsin legislatures of 1893, 1895, 1897; twice chosen
State Treasurer; elected Lieutenant Governor on the
ticket with R. M. LaFollette, and upon the election of the
latter to the United States Senate succeeded him as governor
in January, 1906. In the summer of that year Senator
LaFollette vainly stumped the State to prevent Davidson’s
nomination for Governor on the Republican ticket,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>and in the election that followed the Norwegian-born,
soundly-experienced Governor was chosen by the handsome
plurality of 80,247 votes.<a id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> In 1908 he was re-elected
by a plurality of 76,958.</p>

<p>Still further up the political scale, men from Northwestern
Europe have been taking an active part in national
affairs. Sixteen of them have been elected to the House
of Representatives of the Federal Congress. The first one
to achieve this high position was Knute Nelson who sat
in the House from 1883 to 1889 as the Representative of
the Fifth Minnesota District. In 1895 he was chosen
United States Senator and has served continuously since
March 4, 1895.<a id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Others who have served for several terms
in the House are: Nils P. Haugen, a Norwegian representing
a Wisconsin district from 1887 to 1895; John Lind,
a Swede, who represented the Second Minnesota District
from 1887 to 1893; Asle J. Gronna, who was a member of
the House from 1905 to 1909, and succeeded Johnson as
Senator from North Dakota, serving up to the present time;
Gilbert N. Haugen, another Wisconsin-born Norwegian,
who has represented the Fourth Iowa District since 1899;
Andrew J. Volstead, a Minnesota-born Norwegian, who
has sat for the Seventh Minnesota District since 1903; and
Halvor Steenerson, born in Dane County, Wisconsin, of
Norwegian stock, who has represented the Ninth Minnesota
District since 1903.<a id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Martin N. Johnson, who was born of
Norwegian parents in Wisconsin, had his first legislative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>experience in the Iowa legislature, sat in the House as
representative at large from the new State of North Dakota
from 1891 to 1899, and then, after a period of retirement,
was sent to the United States Senate from the same
State, serving from March, 1909, until his death in October
of the same year.</p>

<p>An analysis of this list of Representatives shows that
eleven of the sixteen were Norwegians of the first or second
generation of immigrant stock, four were Swedes, and one
a Dane. Six of the eleven were born in America, three of
them in the old Wisconsin settlements; only one of these
represented the district in which he was born, the rest
receiving their reward in the newer western sections into
which they had migrated with the movement of population
beyond the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Different Federal administrations have deemed it wise
to “recognize” the Scandinavian among other elements of
the political population, in making appointments in the
diplomatic and consular services of the United States. One
of the most notable instances is that of the selection of
John Lind, the former governor of Minnesota, as the personal
representative of President Wilson in Mexico during
the troubled months of 1913 and 1914 and as adviser to the
United States embassy in Mexico City during the period
following the recall of Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson.
Another instance of appointment in this service is that of
Lauritz Selmer Swenson, a Norwegian of the second generation,
born in Minnesota, who was minister to Denmark
from 1897 to 1906, and later received appointments as
minister to Switzerland and to Norway, terminating the
latter in 1913.<a id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Rasmus B. Anderson represented the
United States at the Danish court from 1885 to 1889, being
at that time a Democrat. He was born in Wisconsin of
pure Norse parentage, and had served as professor of the
Scandinavian languages in the University of Wisconsin.<a id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The appointment of Nicolay A. Grevstad as minister
to Uruguay and Paraguay in 1911 was a fitting recognition
of ability combined with long and able service to the people
of the older, or middle, Northwest as editor of the <i>Minneapolis
Tribune</i>, the <i>Minneapolis Times</i>, and the great Chicago
daily, <i>Skandinaven</i> (1902-1911). Hans Mattson, a
Swedish veteran of the Civil War, was consul general at
Calcutta from 1883 to 1885;<a id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Soren Listoe, the Danish
editor of <i>Nordvesten</i> of St. Paul, Minnesota, was consul at
Düsseldorf, 1882-3, consul at Rotterdam, 1897-1902, and
consul general at the same city, 1902-1914.<a id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> At Rotterdam
he succeeded L. S. Reque, a Norwegian from Iowa. Several
other men have served for long terms in minor positions in
the foreign service.<a id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">Party Preferences and Political Leadership</p>


<p>The great majority of the Scandinavians, prior to
1884, were thoro-going and uncompromising Republicans,
and tho the party still holds most of them, profiting largely
from their natural conservatism and their loyalty to a
principle, it can by no means depend upon them with the
assurance it had in the “good old days” when to find a
Scandinavian voter in the Northwest was to find a Republican.</p>

<p>The causes which determined the early party affiliations
of the naturalized sons of the Vikings, in the broad
area of State and Federal affairs, are to be found in the
character of the immigrants themselves and in the great
questions agitating the country at the time they became
citizens. Coming to the United States with an endowment
of natural independence, with an innate respect for government,
and with an inclination for public concerns, their
interest was at once actively aroused in the great problem
of slavery that vexed national life from the time of the
Sloop Folk to the Civil War. As their information about
the slave system grew more exact, and as the tremendous
significance of the restriction of the slave area as a cardinal
political issue was made clear to their minds, they
became of one mind in the mighty agitation. Neither they
nor their ancestors for hundreds of years had held slaves;
few of them had ever seen a slave, for their numerous traders
and sailors, with slight exceptions, had no smell of
blood of the African slave trade on their hands.<a id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It was
not chance, therefore, which kept the stream of North
European immigrants from flowing into the South and
Southwest; no attractiveness of climate or soil could compensate
for the presence of Negro slavery. A horror and
hatred of slavery colored their thinking from their first
month in the New World; it was first a moral, then a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>political, conviction, not the sentiment of individuals, but
the well-reasoned opinion of the whole community.</p>

<p>Bound together on this great question, then so dominant,
they naturally maintained unity on other political
questions as well as on slavery; and when once their ideas
were fixed, any change would be effected slowly and with
difficulty. The newcomers, in their first months in the
older settlements, were speedily indoctrinated with anti-slavery
sentiment. Thus it came about that one party
received and retained the vast majority of the Scandinavians
down to 1884, simply because a bent that way was
given in the early years of immigration from the Northern
peninsulas, and because the question of the status of the
Negro, in one form or another, continued to be a political
issue.</p>

<p>The first appearance of the Norwegians in State politics
in Wisconsin, as already noted, was under the Free
Soil banner between 1846 and 1848, when that State was
endeavoring to form a constitution. The first constitution
submitted to the people, in 1847, was rejected by a large
majority, including a separately-submitted provision
granting equal suffrage to Negroes. While the State
decisively voted thus, the counties in which the Scandinavian
vote was largest—Racine, Walworth, and Waukesha—showed
large majorities in favor of giving the
Negroes political privileges equal to those of the Whites.
On the other hand, counties where the German votes were
numerous stood solidly against equal suffrage, seemingly
because in the constitutional convention the question of
Negro suffrage was coupled with that of the granting of
suffrage to foreign-born, in a way that greatly displeased
the Germans.<a id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> When the second convention finished its
constitution, in 1848, resolutions were introduced to provide
for printing and distributing translations of the document,
6000 copies in German, and 4000 copies in Norwegian,
a hint of the relative strength of the two groups.<a id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The relation of James Reymert and his <i>Nordlyset</i> to
the Free Soil movement has been mentioned. When the
Democratic papers mercilessly criticised the little sheet
and poked fun at its name, the paper was sold by Reymert
to Knud Langeland in 1849, and by him removed to Racine;
the name was changed to <i>Demokraten</i>, but the politics
of the paper were not affected.<a id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> As a political organ
among the Norwegians, it was ahead of the times; the
support of the paper was insufficient to pay the bills, and
it was discontinued in 1850. The Norwegian immigrants
were unaccustomed to a purely secular press; they preferred
to have their politics wrapped up in papers labelled
“religious.” Langeland declares that many of them considered
it a sin to read a political newspaper.<a id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> But the
Free Soil sentiment was too strong to go without printed
expression in Norwegian; and accordingly the propaganda
continued in the form of speeches of Chase, Seward, Hale,
Giddings, and other anti-slavery leaders, which were translated
into Norwegian and mixed in with non-political
matter in <i>Maanedstidende</i>, a paper whose publication,
after the failure of <i>Demokraten</i>, Langeland undertook
along with four clergymen, Clausen, Preuss, Stub, and
Hatlestad.<a id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>As they read these speeches of the great leaders, as
they heard from Negroes themselves the evils of slavery,
as they learned of the high-handed doings in Kansas, the
zeal of the Scandinavians for human freedom increased.
There were no old party traditions, feelings, or feuds, to
keep them from judging the issue of slavery’s expansion
on its merits; no loyalty to the memories of dead heroes
held them in mortmain. Some few of them voted for Cass
in 1848 and for Pierce in 1852, but by 1856 there was only
one issue for them: simply and straightforwardly and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>almost to a man, they became Republicans.<a id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The Democrats,
of course, did not let the children of the North go
without an effort to secure them in their ranks. In 1856
Elias Stangeland of Madison, Wisconsin, started a Norwegian
paper, <i>Den Norske Amerikaner</i>, in support of
James Buchanan. His efforts to get Langeland to undertake
the editorship failed because the latter was an ardent
admirer of Fremont. The paper had a short life, and
probably Langeland is right in attributing its disappearance
to the withdrawal of the Democratic subsidy.<a id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> A
long time was to elapse before a successful attempt would
be made to maintain a Democratic paper in Norwegian or
Swedish.</p>

<p>What the anti-slavery agitation left undone towards
making the Scandinavians unswervingly Republican, was
accomplished by the Civil War. The lingering glories of
the golden age of the Democracy of Jackson and Jefferson
were entirely obscured by the attitude of the Democratic
party toward the conduct of the war. Only when the
memories of the Civil War grew less vivid and less influential
with new arrivals from the Old World, and not until
moral questions were superseded in political discussions
by economic questions relating to the tariff, currency,
and labor, did the Scandinavians begin to arrange themselves
in any considerable numbers outside the Republican
ranks.</p>

<p>Four times during the last thirty-five years the Scandinavian
voters in large numbers, under varying circumstances
and in different degrees in different States, have
abjured Republican leadership. After each such excursion
they have returned, for the most part, to their old party
relations, but never with quite the same fervent, reliable
zeal for Republican principles and candidates. The development
of the bacillus of independence is unmistakable.
One defection affected Wisconsin alone, the only instance
where the Democrats profited directly by the votes of large
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>numbers of Scandinavians. At a later time, when the Free
Silver and Populist ideas took strong hold on the Northwest,
the Scandinavian vote re-enforced the personal popularity
of John Lind, the Swedish candidate of the Populist-Democratic
party, and secured his election, tho the
rest of the Fusion ticket suffered defeat.</p>

<p>The first time Norse voters broke from the Republican
ranks was in connection with the Greenback movement
which began with the depression following the panic of
1873 and culminated in the election of 1880. Many of
them, especially the Swedes in Illinois, became out-and-out
Greenbackers or Independents. In his book on the Swedes
in Illinois, published in 1880, C. F. Peterson gives brief
biographies of some seven hundred Swedes, men of all
walks of life above day laborer, who may be considered as
representatives of the 40,000 Swedes in Illinois at that
time.<a id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> At least they represent the classes which would be
least likely to be led off into economic heresies. Of 628
whose party affiliations are stated, 472 were Republicans;
76, Independents; 55, Greenbackers; and 25, Democrats or
Prohibitionists. In other words, out of the total number
canvassed, more than twenty per-cent were dissenters from
Republican orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The relation of political and religious sentiment is
strikingly illustrated in analyzing these biographies, for
those who were Lutherans or Methodists were usually
Republicans in politics, and proud to belong to “the party
of moral ideas.”<a id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Those stating their religious preferences
as Lutheran numbered 388, and of these only 10 were
Democrats, 16 were Greenbackers, and 19 were Independent.
On the other hand, of 131 who belonged to the three
political parties last mentioned, 87 were in religion also
Independent, Free Thinkers, or “Ingersollites”. For
States other than Illinois, no such complete contemporary
data are available; but since the Greenback vote in Minnesota
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>was only 2% of the total, and in Wisconsin 3%, it is
fair to assume that the Scandinavians did not desert the
Republican standard in very large numbers in those States.</p>

<p>The second case of considerable defection among the
Republican Scandinavians occurred after the widespread
development of agrarian discontent in the late eighties.
The farmers and laborers, American and Scandinavian
alike, felt the stress of hard times, turned to political
agencies for relief, forsook the old parties, and formed the
party called variously the Populist, People’s, and Farmers’
Alliance Party. Besides those Norwegians and Swedes
who had been for years Republicans, whose political color
was fixed by the mordant of slavery and the Civil War,
there was then a very large number of men who arrived in
the vast immigrant invasions between 1880 and 1885, and
who were just coming into the full exercise of the rights of
citizenship. An increasing proportion of these later arrivals
went to the large cities and towns. All of them were
moved less by the traditions of “moral ideas” and more by
the contagious discontent of the older settlers and by the
arguments of industrial and political agitators.</p>

<p>In the election of 1890 a serious break occurred in the
Republican Party in Minnesota and in the Dakotas. There
was a general impression in the rural districts of Minnesota
that the Republican candidate for governor, William
R. Merriam, a wealthy banker of St. Paul, was renominated
for his second term by a political ring composed of
lumber-kings, wheat dealers, and millers who combined to
cheat and rob the farmer. Accordingly the Farmers’ Alliance
nominated a third ticket headed by S. M. Owen, the
editor of an agricultural paper in Minneapolis, who polled
a vote of 58,513, and reduced Merriam’s vote of 1888 by
about 46,000.<a id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Merriam was re-elected by a plurality of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>less than 2,500, tho he had had more than 24,000 two years
before.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the votes for 1888 and 1890
in such strong Scandinavian counties as Otter Tail, Douglas,
Chisago, Freeborn, Polk, and Norman leaves no doubt
that the Swedes and Norwegians in very large numbers
either voted for Owen, or refused to vote for Merriam.<a id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
In some cases the Republican vote fell off one-half and
even two-thirds, and third-party Alliance candidates for the
legislature were elected. A prominent Norwegian writer
estimated that “25,000 Norwegian-born farmers turned
their backs upon Mr. Merriam and voted for Mr. Owen for
governor,” disregarding the injunction of the Scandinavian
Republican press to “stick to the grand old party, for the
grand old party is particularly favorable to the Scandinavians,
and the best political party in America.”<a id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>At the next state election in the presidential year,
1892, a Norwegian ran for governor on the Republican
ticket, and a large part of the Scandinavian deserters
wheeled into line and voted the Republican ticket. With
a total vote only 15,000 greater than in 1890, the vote for
the Republican candidate for governor increased in round
number 20,000, for the Democratic candidate, 9,000, and
for the Prohibition candidate, 4,000, while the vote of the
Alliance or People’s party fell off 20,000.<a id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Conditions in North Dakota and South Dakota were
even more favorable to the new party than in Minnesota.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Estimates based on a study of statistics and newspapers
have been confirmed by prominent officials of those States,
one of whom declares that “in some localities quite a per-cent
has joined the Populist party; but it is very rare
indeed to find a Scandinavian Democrat.”<a id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Another believes
that a considerable portion of the Scandinavians
voted the Populist ticket in 1892 and in 1894, but that they
were normally believers in the protective principle and
therefore naturally affiliated with the Republican party.<a id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
A German lawyer of Valley City, North Dakota, a Democrat,
practically agreed with the Norwegian city attorney
of Devil’s Lake in the same State, the one saying that a
large part of the Norse voters were Populists, the other
declaring that the Populist party was largely composed of
Scandinavians.<a id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> All agreed that these voters later tended
to return to their former Republican alliance. It may be
doubted, however, whether the hold of the protection idea
is one of the primary reasons for Scandinavian Republicanism.
At any rate the vote of the Hon. Knute Nelson
for the Mills Bill for tariff revision in 1888—one of six
Republican votes for the measure—did not make him politically
<i>persona non grata</i> or a suspicious character among
his Norwegian or Swedish brethren.</p>

<p>Another index of the shifting of political sentiment
among the Norse voters is found in the changes in the
party affiliations of Scandinavian newspapers, tho the
varying importance of these journals imposes special caution
in interpreting these figures. It would be obviously
unfair to offset the staunch and well-supported Republicanism
of the ably-edited and widely-circulated <i>Skandinaven</i>
of Chicago with the less stable <i>Normannen</i> of Stoughton,
Wisconsin, which had not one-third the circulation nor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>one-tenth of the influence of the metropolitan journal.<a id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
The “mugwump spirit” of the press is well illustrated by
the case of <i>Norden</i>, a Norwegian weekly of Chicago, Republican
up to 1884, when it took an independent attitude.
In 1888 it became avowedly Democratic and supported
Grover Cleveland for the presidency. This move was made
only after the proprietor and editor assured themselves
that the patrons of the paper would sustain them in the
proposed change.<a id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>Of the secular political Scandinavian papers published
in Minnesota in 1889 nine were Republican—five
Norwegian or Norwegian-Danish, four Swedish; three
were Democratic,—all Norwegian; two were Prohibitionist,—one Norwegian and
  one Swedish; and one was Labor,—Norwegian.<a id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
In the next five years, the independent press
in Minnesota and other states increased in numbers at
least, and included such influential journals as <i>Amerika</i>
and <i>Folkebladet</i>. George Taylor Rygh, professor of Scandinavian
languages in the University of North Dakota,
estimated in 1893 that “until a few years ago over four-fifths
of the [Scandinavian] secular press were strictly
Republican in politics. One after another has ceased to
defend the Republican party, and today not more than
one-third of the whole number are strictly Republican.”<a id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
While this personal opinion or impression is probably exaggerated,
it may represent approximately the temporary
state of that year if proper emphasis be laid on the word
“strictly.” Since there appears to be no evidence that these
papers, with two or three exceptions, were subsidized to
induce their change of political creed, it is reasonable to
conclude that they had behind them a solidified constituency,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>for
they were run neither for personal amusement, pure philanthropy, nor mere
partisan propaganda.</p>

<p>The third defection occurred in Wisconsin alone, and
took its rise in a purely local question. Its interest lies in
the peculiar and remarkable temporary alliance to which
it led. The Wisconsin Legislature passed an act, approved
April 18, 1889, “concerning the education and employment
of children.”<a id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> To the ordinary provisions for coercing
parents and children, so that all children between the ages
of seven and fourteen years should attend at least twelve
weeks in some public or private school in the city or town
or district in which they lived, nobody objected. But the
fifth section of the act, which was known as the Bennett
Law, was in certain church circles, like a dash of vitriol
in the face:</p>

<p>“No school shall be regarded as a school under this
act unless there shall be taught therein as a part of the
elementary education of the children, reading, writing,
arithmetic, and United States history, in the English language.”</p>

<p>The last four words of this section, innocent and reasonable
as they look to the average American, stirred up
one of the bitterest political fights ever known in Wisconsin.
The Roman Catholic church, unalterably committed
to a system of parochial schools in many of which instruction
is given in a foreign language, was for once in accord
with the German and Scandinavian Lutherans who maintained
similar schools. The compulsory use of English in
instructing pupils in specified subjects turned priests and
pastors and whole congregations into active, vociferous
politicians, for Germans, Norwegians, Poles, and Bohemians
claimed the right to educate their children in parochial
schools of their own choosing. Was not education
education, whether carried on in English or German or
Polish or Norwegian? Were not the graduates of church
schools, even tho they spoke English brokenly or with
brogue, just as intelligent, just as capable, just as industrious,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>and just as honest, as those educated in the “little
red school house” and the public high school?<a id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The chairman
of the Lutheran Committee on School Legislation
stated the matter clearly from the standpoint of the
churches:</p>

<p>“The Lutherans of Wisconsin do not oppose the Bennett
Law because they are the enemies of the English
language.... The Lutherans oppose the present compulsory
school law because—whether designedly or not—it in
fact infringes on the rights of conscience guaranteed by
the constitution, and the right of parents to educate according
to their convictions, their own children.... In
short, the Lutherans insist upon their right to establish
private schools at their own expense, and regulate them,
without any interference on the part of the State, ... that
their children may become Lutheran Christians as
well as loyal and good citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The official circular of
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin,
dated January 25, 1890, almost a year after the passage
of the act, was a statement of the opposite point of view,
and a justification of attempts to enforce the law. Incidentally
it was a political pamphlet as well. Superintendent
Thayer said: “The thing that is antagonized by this
law is the practice of allowing children of this State of
proper school age, to pass that period of life without acquiring
the minimum of education in elementary branches;
without acquiring the ability to think in the language of
the country, to express themselves intelligibly in that language,
orally, in writing, and in business forms.”</p>

<p>All through the latter part of 1889 and the first ten
months of 1890, the agitation went on. The press gave
great space to it; some papers through several months,
both in Wisconsin and in the neighboring States where
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>Lutherans and Catholics were numerous, offered “symposiums”
which printed arguments on both sides.<a id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> <i>Public
Opinion</i> summarized the sentiment for the larger world.<a id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
Church assemblies took action, and finally an Anti-Bennett
Law convention was held in Milwaukee, June 4, 1890.</p>

<p>The Democrats were not slow in seizing the advantage
offered, and managed their campaign of 1890 very shrewdly.
The combination of sternly anti-Catholic German and
Norwegian Lutherans, usually Republican, with Roman
Catholics, under the Democratic banner, was irresistible.
In spite of the frantic appeals of the Republican press and
speakers for loyalty to the American flag and to the “little
red school house,” the Democrats elected their candidate
for governor, and a legislature pledged to give the desired
relief. By the six-line act of February 5, 1891, the Bennett
Law was repealed, and two months later another compulsory
education act was passed without the offensive and
troublesome four words.<a id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> The work of the Lutheran-Catholic
alliance was done; the heterogeneous, naturally
antagonistic elements fell apart; and in a few years old
party lines were re-established. The plurality of 28,000
by which the Democratic Governor, G. W. Peck, was elected
in 1890, overcoming the usual Republican plurality of
about 20,000, was reduced at his re-election in 1892 to
7,700. In 1894 the Republican candidate defeated Governor
Peck by the handsome plurality of 50,000 votes.<a id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>While the Bennett Law agitation was going on in
Wisconsin, a similar, but milder disturbance occurred in
Illinois. The compulsory education act of the latter State,
which went into effect July 1, 1889, was closely, if not
deliberately, modelled after the Wisconsin statute, and
enacted that “no school shall be regarded as a school under
this act, unless there shall be taught therein in the English
language, reading, writing, arithmetic, history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>United
States, and geography.”<a id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> In
the campaign of 1890, the Republican candidate for State Superintendent of
Education, favoring the new compulsory education law,
was defeated by some 36,000 votes by Raab, the Democratic
candidate who opposed the law. The Norwegians and
Danes in the city of Chicago probably voted for Raab in
large numbers, tho he won the Swedish wards of that city
by small pluralities. In such counties as Knox, with its
two thousand Swedish voters, and Winnebago (in which
is situated the city of Rockford, with about fifteen hundred
Swedish voters), where one-third of the foreign born population
was at that time Scandinavian, the Republican
candidate received large majorities. A writer for <i>America</i>,
the periodical published in English for Scandinavian readers,
claimed proudly that “the large Swedish settlements
in Henry, Rock Island, Bureau, De Kalb, Henderson, Warren,
Mercer, Ford, Whiteside, and other counties cast a
solid vote for Edwards.... The Swedes were in
favor of compulsory education almost to a man.”<a id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> In
the city of Chicago, the County Superintendent of Schools for
Cook County was re-elected by a plurality of 23,000 tho
he favored the compulsory law. The repeal of the law of
1889 was not so prompt in Illinois as it was in Wisconsin,
for it was not until 1893 that a new and expurgated compulsory
education measure took its place.<a id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>A close and detailed examination of the legislative
journals and the statutes of the Northwestern States does
not reveal above a half-dozen laws which can be said to be
due to the leadership and direct influence of the Scandinavians
as such. On the other hand, in the field of general
legislation these men have been indistinguishable from the
native-born in ability, efficiency, and uprightness; the
gross and net products of the labors of those legislatures
with many Scandinavian representatives in such states as
Minnesota and North Dakota, are not perceptibly different
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>from the output of legislatures in which no Swede or Norwegian
ever sat, as in Michigan or Colorado. Scarcely a
law has been passed for the purpose of catering to the
preferences, or of catching the vote, of the sons of the
Northlands.</p>

<p>An exception to this general statement is the Minnesota
law of 1883 providing for the establishment of a “professorship
of Scandinavian language and literature in the
State University, with the same salary as is paid in said
University to other professors of the same grade.” The
man to be chosen must be “some person learned in the
Scandinavian language and literature, and at the same
time skilled and capable of teaching the dead languages so
called.”<a id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The motives of the makers of the law were benevolent
enough, and circumstances warranted its passage, but
nothing could better illustrate the utter carelessness and
looseness with which American State legislators do their
work, than this simple statute. It was drawn up by a
distinguished American lawyer, Gordon E. Cole of St. Paul,
at the request of Truls Paulsen by whom it was introduced
into the legislature.<a id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> It
created a chair of “Scandinavian language,” when there is no such language,
living or dead; the professorship was established “in the State University,”
when the laws of the State recognize no institution
bearing such a name. The Norwegian who presented the
bill, the legislature (including twenty-one other Norwegians
and Swedes) which passed it, and the Governor who signed
it, all showed the same quality of ignorance and neglect of
fact, law, and English. A second law, undoubtedly based
directly upon the first, even to copying its confusion of
terms, was the act passed by the legislature of North Dakota
in 1891, creating a chair of Scandinavian language
and literature in the University of North Dakota.<a id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Another statute having still more distinct Scandinavian
earmarks was passed by the legislature of North
Dakota in 1893, providing for tribunals of conciliation, to
be composed of four commissioners of conciliation elected
in each town, incorporated village, and city. The measure
was modelled in a feeble and tentative fashion after a
statute of Norway, where such courts have been in operation
since 1824, proving especially efficient in securing
amicable adjustment of petty neighborhood difficulties.<a id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
But the law in North Dakota speedily fell into “innocuous
desuetude,” in spite of the enormous percentage of Norwegians
in that State; its construction was defective; its
constitutionality was questioned; its machinery was cumbersome
and expensive. During its first two years, many
communities failed to elect commissioners, and no serious
attempt was made to comply with its provisions; even the
Norwegians themselves manifested no anxiety or haste to
make use of this characteristically Norwegian court. Nor
did the amendment of 1895, substituting for compulsory
use of the tribunal hearings at the request of one party
and with the consent of both parties, improve matters. One
Norwegian attorney pronounced the law “an unmitigated
absurdity under present conditions,” because most suits in
the United States arise out of contracts, debts, titles, etc.,
rather than out of neighborhood quarrels, slanders, and
the like.</p>

<p>In all matters relating to temperance and temperance
legislation, the Scandinavian voters have almost invariably
been on the side of restriction of the saloon and the liquor
traffic. They have supported prohibition in Iowa and in
the Dakotas, high license in Minnesota, and the patrol-limit
system in Minneapolis.<a id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The prohibition State and
local tickets, especially in Minnesota, and in the Dakotas,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>always have a large proportion of Norwegians and Swedes
among their nominees.<a id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The best illustration of this sentiment,
however, is to be found in the history of prohibition
in North Dakota. When the new constitution for the
proposed State was made and presented to the people in
1889, the section which provided for the absolute prohibition
of both the manufacture and sale of intoxicating
liquors was submitted separately to the voters. Thus the
prohibition issue was presented fairly and squarely to every
man in the State. The constitution itself was carried by
a majority approximating twenty thousand in a total vote
of upwards of thirty-five thousand; the prohibitionist section
received a majority of 1159. Analysis of the vote by
counties makes it clear that in every county where the
Scandinavians predominated, with a single exception, the
section was carried by fair majorities.<a id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The question of
re-submission of this section to the vote of the people of
the State came up in 1895, and was postponed indefinitely
by the House of Representatives of the State of North
Dakota by a vote of twenty-six to twenty-two, fourteen of
the sixteen Scandinavian members of the House voting with
the twenty-six.<a id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> This seems to justify the opinion of the
Secretary of State of North Dakota: “Nearly all Scandinavian
members of the legislature have invariably voted
against the resubmission of the question to the people....
It is safe to say that at least three-fourths of the Scandinavian
population of this State favor prohibition, and one-half
of them are earnest advocates of the law.”<a id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>The only remaining question as to the political influence
of the Scandinavians is the claim of the Swedes and
Norwegians for “recognition” at the hands of old parties;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>and the concessions which such claims have extorted.
From the foregoing accounts, it is evident that the Scandinavians
have been ready in fitting themselves into the
political system of the United States. Altho they have
not been guilty of that excessive and pernicious activity
in the field of public affairs which has characterized some
classes of immigrants settling by preference in the great
cities, it must be admitted that they have now and then
appealed to race pride and prejudice and jealousy, re-marking
boundary lines and distinctions which should be
obliterated. The practical politicians, on their part, have
not hesitated to stir up, for party advantage, the sensitiveness
of naturalized citizens to real or imaginary slights
and discriminations against them by “the other party.”</p>

<p>The appeal of the Norwegian and Swedish press is not
infrequently based frankly on the essential sentiment of
clannishness: “Scandinavians in Superior and other places
should always support a country man for election to public
office,” and if he is in all ways worthy, “we should all
together rally around him, lay aside all small considerations,
and honor him with our trust and esteem.”<a id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Ridiculing
the narrowness of these “demands,” another editor,
under the heading “From Norway, Birthplace of Giants,”
suggests a full Republican ticket of Norwegians, including
Rasmus B. Anderson, “Republican pro tem.,” and also a
full Democratic ticket of Norwegians, including Rasmus
B. Anderson, “thinking that he may next year be a Democrat
again.”<a id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> This trick of asserting their political importance
in the Northwestern States was very early
learned; and so long as party managers bid for votes in the
tongues of the aliens, bribing them with nominations of
the foreign-born, just so long will these groups of adopted
citizens reiterate and multiply their demands, just so long
will they capitalize their voting power and collect a generous
interest in the shape of nominations and appointments.
It must not be supposed that the Norwegian and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Swedish party papers in America exist for the primary
purpose of forwarding the political interests of people of
those nationalities as such, for they do not, any more than
do the partisan papers printed in English, but the Scandinavian
groups are so large and so definite that appeals
to them to stand together as a race for their own interests
are inevitable.</p>

<p>So early as 1870, one of the leading Norwegian newspapers
declared that it was time for the Norwegians to get
a Representative in Congress just as well as other nationalities—“<i>ligesaavel
som andre nationaliteter</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The
editor suggested that the eight thousand Norse voters in
the southern Minnesota district hold a convention the day
before the regular Republican convention, and agree upon
a candidate for the Congressional nomination: if the
Republicans refused to nominate him, put on the screws!
About twenty years later this very method was resorted
to in North Dakota, when the Scandinavians of that State
“in mass convention assembled,” proceeded to pass resolutions
and to organize the Scandinavian Union of North
Dakota, to secure for themselves “that share in the government
to which their competency, their character and numerical
strength, and their rank as pioneers in all matters
of civilization entitle them.” While declaring that it
believed that every man should stand or fall on his own
merits, the convention resolved “that we have seen with
deep regret the disposition of a large number of our fellow
citizens in some parts of North Dakota to discriminate
against us, because we are Scandinavians, and that an
unprovoked war has been waged against us.”<a id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The Hon.
M. N. Johnson, presiding officer, presumptive beneficiary
of the Union, an aspirant for nomination as Representative,
stated the case very frankly: “The Scandinavians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>constitute a majority of the Republican party in North
Dakota. Under the territorial government they have not
received many official favors, but with the opening of statehood
it is proper that they should have some recognition.
The Scandinavians are not disposed to leave the Republican
Party. They are heartily loyal to the organization and
its principles.... We have the numerical strength to
demand and secure justice, and all we ask is fair play....
We are simply organizing our forces for united action in
urging our just demands.”<a id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Their just demands consisted
in “from three to five of the State officers, and if they stand
together and attend the primaries, there is no doubt but
that they will get what they ask for.”<a id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The effectiveness of this movement is sarcastically
summed up by a correspondent of <i>The North</i>, in reporting
the Republican convention: “M. N. Johnson’s Scandinavian
League has evidently come out of the small end of the
horn. To be sure M. N. was made the chairman of the
convention and the dear Scandinavians got honorary
mention in the resolutions: but M. N.’s chairmanship was
evidently devoid of results beneficial to the Scandinavians,
and as for resolutions—talk is cheap!”<a id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>In an editorial in English <i>Skandinaven</i> discussed
“Governor Sheldon’s Mistake” in 1893: “Upwards of one-third
of the population of South Dakota is of Scandinavian
birth or origin, while Scandinavians furnish not less than
one-half of the Republican vote of the State. Governor
Sheldon is apparently oblivious to this fact; for in making
his appointments he saw fit to ignore the Scandinavian-American
citizens of South Dakota. For the sake of the
Republican party of the State this mistake is very much
to be regretted. The Scandinavians are sensitive of their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>rights as American citizens.... What has the Republican
party of South Dakota done to Governor Sheldon
that he should deal it such a dangerous blow?”<a id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Five
years later the governor of Minnesota was accused of a
like offence in that, on the State boards appointed by
Governor Merriam, the Scandinavians were “insufficiently
represented,” having only five out of one hundred members,
or one-twenty-fifth, when they constituted one-third
of the population of the State.<a id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>The pettiness of these squabbles over political “recognition”
and spoils is well illustrated by a letter written in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to a Minneapolis newspaper in 1889:
“While our people here number over 3000, and the Irish
only 1400, the latter hold a still larger percentage of offices
than they do in your city. This year for the first time the
Scandinavians (or more correctly speaking, the Danes)
have succeeded in obtaining a place on the police force”!<a id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>These insistent demands do not stop with simple recognition
of the Scandinavian race: different sections must
be satisfied. The most influential Swedish paper of the
Northwest announced in 1890 that “what we on the other
hand with full propriety and without the least danger of
transgression can demand, is a man of Swedish descent at
the head of one of our State departments.... To deny
them (Swedes) this just recognition would stir up bad
feeling, and would be looked upon as a slight, not to say
contempt.... Our brethren, the Norwegians, are a
little more numerous in Minnesota, than the Swedes, although
not equally good Republicans. They, too, are entitled
to a place on the State ticket, and for a long time have
had one [Lieutenant Governor Rice].”<a id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>The failure of the Scandinavians to receive what some
of them consider a just and due reward, one in proportion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>to their numbers and their devotion to one party, is not to
be attributed wholly to the hardness of heart of the party
leaders, nor to their shortsightedness. Nor can it be fairly
charged to any strong dislike of Swedes, Norwegians, and
Danes for each other: the Swedes, for example, have never
bolted a ticket because it happened to be headed by a
Norwegian.<a id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> In addition to the extension of religious
antagonism into politics, “there is still another reason for
the limited success of the Scandinavians in the political
field, and that is their natural apathy [antipathy?] to
following a leader. Each one considers himself competent
to work on his own hook. To follow a leader seems incompatible
with their ideas of liberty. Yet without union and
without leaders, victory is impossible.... ‘Everybody
for himself, and the Devil for the hindmost’ is the law
governing American life, and this the Irish have learned,
while the Scandinavian is generally waiting for someone
to come along and offer something with the polite ‘if you
please.’ But he has to wait.”<a id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The Scandinavian press, in complaining of “a failure
to get a due share of offices,” in declaring that Norwegians
are “entitled to ten seats” in the Wisconsin legislature
when they happen to have but three, or in insinuating that
they have never been fittingly recognized in Iowa, resorts
to political claptrap, often quite unworthy of the journal
printing it. The facts so easily forgotten are that the
counties and legislative districts in which the Scandinavians
are a ruling majority are comparatively few, while
the districts in which they are an influential minority are
very many.<a id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The system of representation in the United
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>States is not based on any racial divisions or class distinctions,
and not until some scheme of minority representation
is adopted can any foreign element get its “share” of
the political plums. It would be hard to suggest a more
dangerous and disrupting experiment, in these decades
when aliens by the hundreds of thousands, not to say millions,
enter the country and are incorporated into the body
politic, than to attempt to “recognize” the various alien
factors in complex public affairs, even if they were all as
adaptable as the men from the Northlands. Nothing
would do more, for example, to develop the latent religious
and racial antipathies between the Scandinavians and the
Irish. The fundamental assumption, therefore, which lies
back of all claims for “recognition” of Swedish-Americans,
or other hyphenated Americans, as such, savors of ward
politics and the machine, rather than of political equity or
right, and just so far as it does this it menaces social and
political safety.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">Conclusion</p>


<p>The meaning of the word American as applied to the
inhabitants of the United States, has undergone a great
change as they have multiplied fifteenfold in numbers and
many times in varieties of nationalities in the course of a
century. In that progress the Norwegians, Swedes, and
Danes have played a conspicuous and constructive part.
As late as 1840, American ordinarily meant a white person
of English descent, born in America or resident in the
United States long enough to understand and accept as
fundamental and vital certain political and social ideals
and ideas. That simple and definite significance applies
no more. The American race is already alarmingly complex,
tho the old type has been more closely adhered to
than would be expected from an enumeration of the elements
which have gone into the crucible.</p>

<p>In temperament, early training, and ideals, the Scandinavians
more nearly approach the American type than
any other class of immigrants, except those from Great
Britain. In such features as adaptability and loyalty
without reservation, no exceptions need be made. They
have not come to the New World merely to get away from
Europe, nor to escape Siberian exile or an Abyssinian
war; nor has their motive been one of ordinary adventure-seeking.
Theirs has been a determined purpose and a
serious resolve to “arrive” somewhere in America, and,
finding their places, to fill them with honorable endeavor
and steady ambition. They have come as families, or with
a wholesome desire to establish families for themselves.
Most of them have fallen considerably below the best types
of their own nationalities; their conservatism has sometimes
been of the degenerate sort bordering on stolidity;
their independence and individualism has come painfully
near stubbornness; and their shrewdness has not infrequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
developed into insincerity. They have now and
then manifested a clannishness which led them into disagreeable,
if temporary, complications.</p>

<p>The fact that this characteristic or that tendency
exists in an immigrant or alien element, should not cause
disturbance of mind to the good citizen, the statesman, or
the scholar; the real question is whether this characteristic
or tendency is growing stronger or disappearing more or
less rapidly. For example, is the stolidity of a group deepening,
or does mental agility develop in the second and
third generation? That the Scandinavians have readily
outgrown much of their clannishness, perceptibly quickened
their energies in the new environment, and developed
notably in social, commercial, and political efficiency cannot
be seriously questioned by any one who studies their
activities as a whole, or who has observed them for two
generations.</p>

<p>The immigrants from the North are decently educated,
able-bodied, law-abiding men and women, not illiterates,
paupers, or criminals. They are not here as exiles from
home and country for a few years, after which they purpose
to return to their native lands, there to enjoy a cheap
and narrow idleness. They are in the United States as
citizens, to become thoroly and loyally American. Their
ingrained habits of industry and economy, coupled with a
natural conservatism and shrewdness, have given them
material success and contributed in large measure to the
prosperity of the States in which they have made their
settlements. They have ever striven for homes, and while
some of them have been content for a few years to serve
others, the proletariat has not been largely recruited from
them. Mere wage-earning has not been a permanent condition,
but a stepping stone to a greater or less degree of
independence. In politics and in war they have evidenced
their ability to stand side by side with the native-born of
New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, and, with
real faithfulness and efficiency to fill such places, low or
high, as shall be opened to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Tho as Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes they will
gradually disappear, becoming indistinguishable from
other Americans, their fundamental characteristics cannot
be blotted out even in the third and fourth generation.
Men do not change so readily, even under the most favorable
conditions. Fresh additions from Europe will continue
to re-enforce the old stock; but they too will be
sturdy, independent, and Protestant. It is not too much
to expect that their virtues of intelligence, patience, persistence,
and thrift, will be preserved as they mingle in the
current of national life. The demand for these qualities
will be steady; the supply on the part of the Scandinavians
will not be readily exhausted. The intermarriage and
amalgamation of two peoples so closely allied as the
Scandinavians and Americans connotes much of promise
and little of danger.</p>

<p>Several forces will continue to operate in the future,
as they have in the past, against perpetuating any distinctively
Scandinavian influence on the population or institutions
of the United States. All three Northern peoples are
particularly free from other than traditional ties and sentimental
attachments binding them to the mother countries.
No one of the three kingdoms is great or powerful in the
affairs of Europe; the heroes of the past, like Gustavus
Adolphus, are too far away in time to affect powerfully
the imaginations of today. Patriotism with them in the
Old World is quite as much a sentiment or love for the
parish or the homestead as it is a fierce and militant passion
for the power and leadership of the nation. No
dramatic outbursts of national feeling, or antagonisms to
ancient enemies, will rekindle old enthusiasms in the American
Scandinavians. Even the prospect of war between
Norway and Sweden, when the former dissolved the Dual
Monarchy, did not profoundly stir the Swedes or Norwegians
in the Northwest; and had war broken out all the
recruits from America could probably have been shipped
across the Atlantic in one voyage of a small steamship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, no great and permanent causes centering
in Europe continually demand their active and intense
sympathy and financial aid, knitting them closely together,
as in the case of the Irish or the Russians. The Scandinavian
contributions to European causes have been filial
and fraternal, never political, never revolutionary, never
such as to raise a national issue in America. Their church
organizations, decentralized, centrifugal rather than centripetal,
recognizing no unity under a temporal head, cannot
be turned into a keen, insinuating political weapon.
They have no secret societies ramifying through their
settlements, no Mafias, “Molly Maguires,” anarchist lodges,
or other badges of ancient servitude or foreign hates.</p>

<p>The Scandinavians, knowing the price of American
citizenship, have paid it ungrudgingly, and are proud of
the possession of the high prerogatives and privileges
conferred. They fit readily into places among the best
and most serviceable of the nation’s citizens; without long
hammering or costly chiseling they give strength and stability,
if not beauty and the delicate refinements of culture,
to the social and economic structure of the United States.</p>

<p>For all these reasons the difficulties of the United
States in adjusting the life and ideals and institutions of
the nation to the presence of foreigners are reduced in the
case of the Scandinavians to a minimum. The Swedes,
Norwegians, and Danes are not likely to furnish great
leaders, but they will be in the front rank of those who
follow with sturdy intelligence and conscience, striving to
make the land of their adoption strong and prosperous,—“a
blessing to the common man,” according to the original
vision of America seen by Sweden’s great king Gustavus
Adolphus. They will be builders, not destroyers; their
greatest service will be as a mighty, silent, steadying influence,
re-enforcing those high qualities which are sometimes
called Puritan, sometimes American, but which in any case
make for local and national peace, progress, and righteousness.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">Critical Essay on Materials and Authorities</p>


<p>The term bibliography does not accurately or fully
describe the materials upon which this study of the Scandinavians
in the Northwest is based. To the printed
sources of all sorts,—official reports of European and
American governments, autobiographies, travels, and the
like—and to a wide range of secondary works, there must
be added much matter relating to the subject gathered by
means of personal interviews, correspondence, and observations
extending over a series of years. The Scandinavian
press is an inexhaustible mine of source material; its
information, in nuggets, flakes, and fine particles, must be
sought for diligently, extracted, refined, and shaped; but
it is the purest source material, nevertheless, comprising
brief autobiographies, letters, personal opinions, description
of surroundings and movements, and contributions to
current discussion in politics, religion, and education. The
county and local histories which multiplied rapidly between
1880 and 1895, and which have not yet ceased to
appear, are not far from the borderland of source material.
Their sketches of men and women and settlements, tho
for the most part of a crude, innocent, laudatory type
based upon brief personal interviews by canvassers and
elaborated according to the varying size of the subscriptions
of individuals, are almost indispensable for certain
statistical purposes.</p>

<p>The customary distinction between source material
and secondary material is often hard to maintain, so recent
is the Scandinavian immigration, and so numerous are the
first-hand and second-hand accounts by contemporaries
participating in or observing the phenomena under consideration.
The Northern peoples settling in the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
States have had no William Bradford for a historian, but
the work of Norelius and Mattson is in a class similar to
that of <i>Plimouth Plantation</i>.</p>

<p>The best bibliography of immigration in general is
that published by the Library of Congress, A. P. C. Griffin
(compiler), <i>A List of Books (with References to Periodicals)
on Immigration</i> (3rd issue, with additions, 1907),
but this is not complete, especially as relating to Scandinavian
immigration. It omits all state documents, but is
strong in its list of Congressional and executive documents.
For the Scandinavian movement, the bibliography
in O. N. Nelson (editor), <i>History of the Scandinavians
and Successful Scandinavians in the United States</i> (2nd
ed., I, 265-295), is the most useful, though it is unfortunately
arranged on a strictly chronological basis in two
parts. It is, however, far from complete, omitting practically
all Federal and State publications, and all periodicals
save for specific mention of certain articles. In the
field of periodicals, is <i>Bibliografi; Svensk-Amerikansk Periodisk
Literatur</i> (being No. 8, <i>Kungl. Bibliothekets Handlingar</i>,
Stockholm, 1886).</p>

<p>In a general way, the following bibliography includes
only those books, pamphlets, periodicals, and newspapers
which were directly used in the preparation of this volume.
In the case of foreign publications, the place as well as the
date of publication is usually given.</p>


<p class="center">DOCUMENTARY SOURCES</p>

<p>1. <i>Official Publications of the United States.</i></p>

<p>Five series of reports published by the Federal Government
are of very great importance in the study of
immigration, both for their scope and their accuracy: the
<i>Reports</i> of the censuses from 1850 to 1910; the <i>Annual
Statistical Abstracts</i> (36 vols., 1879-1913); <i>Annual Reports
of the Commissioner-general of Immigration</i> (17
vols., 1891-1909); <i>Reports from the Consuls of the United
States</i> (notably vol. 22, No. 76, 1887), particularly those
from the consuls in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<i>Special Consular Reports</i> (particularly vol. 30, 1904).
<i>The Report of the Industrial Commission</i> (especially vols.
XV. (1901) and XIX (1902)), contains a vast amount of
recent, complete, and diversified material in the testimony
taken by the Commission and in the well-digested reports
prepared by experts like John R. Commons. The Bureau
of Statistics of the Treasury Department, <i>Immigration
into the United States, showing number, nationality, sex,
age, destination</i> (etc.) <i>from 1820-1903</i> (in <i>Monthly Summary
of Commerce and Finance</i>, June, 1903), gives general
tables and a review in convenient form.</p>

<p>The following reports of committees of the House of
Representatives and of the Senate include usually the
“hearings” of the committees, if any have been held: <i>Report
from the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization</i>,
51 Cong., 2 Sess., H. R. No. 3472 (Owen Report,
1891); 52 Cong., 1 Sess., H. R. No. 2090 (Stump Report,
1892); <i>Report of the Committee on Immigration</i>, 52 Cong.,
2 Sess., S. R. No. 1333 (Chandler Report, 1893); 54 Cong.,
1 Sess., S. R. No. 290 (Lodge Report, 1896); 57 Cong., 2
Sess., S. Doc. No. 62 (Penrose Report, 1902). Special
reports of importance are: <i>Report of the Immigration
Investigating Commission</i> (1895); Edward Young, Chief
of the Bureau of Statistics, <i>Special Report on Immigration</i>,
(42 Cong., 1 Sess., H. Mis. Doc. No. 19 (1871)); and
C. C. Andrews, <i>Report made to the Department of State
on the Conditions of the Industrial Classes in Sweden and
Norway</i> (1874).</p>

<p>In a class by itself is the recent elaborate <i>Report of
the Immigration Commission</i>, S. Docs., 61 Cong., 2-3 Sess.
(Dillingham Report, 1910-1911), 43 vols., of which vols. 1
and 2 (Abstract), 4, 34, and 36 are specially important for
this study. The <i>Report</i> is by far the most scientific,
thorough-going, and detailed study of the nature, extent,
distribution and results of immigration to the United
States, and to a few other countries like Canada, Australia,
and Brazil, which has yet been produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The various annual or biennial legislative handbooks

volumes since 1880: <i>The Legislative Manual of the State
of Minnesota</i>; <i>Wisconsin Blue Book</i>; <i>The Legislative Manual
of North Dakota</i>; <i>South Dakota Political Handbook
and Official and Legislative Manual</i> (sometimes entitled
<i>South Dakota Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Directory</i>).
Of the great number and variety of official State
documents and reports, those most directly useful for this
study are the volumes of statistics of Wisconsin, Illinois,
Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota; those
relating to the State censuses, State institutions (a board<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of control as in Wisconsin and Iowa, or a board of charities
and corrections, for certain institutions, in Minnesota
and South Dakota), commissioners or boards of immigration,
and boards of health. Reports of officers in charge of
immigration matters are in State documents as follows:
Wisconsin, 1853, 1854, 1869-1875, 1880-1882, 1884, 1886,
1897, 1900; Iowa, 1872; Minnesota, 1867-1872. The publications
of certain institutions chiefly supported by the
States, like the Wisconsin Historical Society, the State
Historical Society of Iowa, especially vol. III (1905), and
the Minnesota Historical Society, really fall into this class
of sources.</p>


<p class="center">GENERAL WORKS</p>

<p>The classical work on the broad subject of immigration,
notable alike for the breadth and penetration of its
views, is Richmond Mayo-Smith, <i>Emigration and Immigration:
a Study in Social Science</i> (1890). Two other works
by the same authority, are: <i>Immigration and the Foreign-Born
Population</i> (in vol. III of the <i>Publications of the
American Statistical Assn.</i>, 1893), and <i>Statistics and Sociology</i>
(1895). The <i>Publications</i> of the Immigration Restriction
League take a wide range in 63 pamphlets (1894-1914).
Next to these in importance come: Prescott F.
Hall, <i>Immigration and its Effects upon the United States</i>
(1906), an excellent and compact study, somewhat marred
by the bias of its author, who is secretary of the Restriction
League; J. R. Commons, <i>Races and Immigrants in
America</i> (1907), a popular rather than profound statement,
but the fresh work of a careful scholar; E. A. Steiner,
<i>On the Trail of the Immigrant</i> (1906); S. McLanahan, <i>Our
People of Foreign Speech ... with particular reference
to religious work among them</i> (1904).</p>

<p>A group of more recent works by competent scholars
combining qualities of penetration and popular presentation
in satisfying proportions are: H. P. Fairchild, <i>Immigration:
a World Movement and its American Significance</i>
(1913); J. W. Jenks and W. J. Lauck, <i>The Immigration
Problem</i> (3d ed. revised and enlarged, 1913), by two men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
intimately connected with the making of the Dillingham
Report; E. A. Ross, <i>The Old World in the New: The significance
of past and present immigration to the American
people</i> (1914), especially ch. IV; F. J. Warne, <i>The Immigrant
Invasion</i> (1913), ch. XII.</p>

<p>Of less direct bearing, but valuable: W. J. Bromwell,
<i>History of Immigration to the United States</i> (1856); F. L.
Dingley, <i>European Immigration</i> (1890); F. Kapp, <i>Immigration
and the Commissioners of Immigration of the
State of New York</i> (1870); R. M. LaFollette (editor), <i>The
Making of America</i>, vols. II and VIII (1906); F. A.
Walker, <i>Discussions in Economics and Statistics</i>, vol. II
(1899).</p>

<p>The great mass of periodical literature is listed in
Griffin’s bibliography, already cited. Including general
and special articles and some speeches in the <i>Congressional
Record</i>, nearly 700 titles are arranged chronologically.
The list is incomplete, omitting several articles, dealing
particularly with the Scandinavians.</p>


<p class="center">SPECIAL HISTORIES</p>

<p>Three works deal with the history of the Scandinavian
immigration in a large-spirited, comprehensive way, and
by these characteristics stand out from the mass of less
important works. O. N. Nelson (compiler and editor),
<i>History of the Scandinavians and Successful Scandinavians
in the United States</i> (2 vols., 2nd revised ed., 1904),
is made up of specially prepared articles, reprinted articles,
statistical tables, a bibliography, and some two hundred
and eighty biographies of men in Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Iowa. It is very uneven, and on almost every page
betrays at once the zeal, honesty, and the inadequate training
of the authors and the compiler. It might almost be
characterized as a cyclopedia of the Scandinavians in
America. E. Norelius, <i>De Svenska Luterska Församlingarnas
och Svenskarnes Historia i Amerika</i> (1890), while
nominally a church history is in reality an excellent history
of Swedish settlement; George T. Flom, <i>A History of Norwegian
Immigration to the United States from the Earliest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Beginning down to the Year 1848</i> (1909), made up in part
of articles mentioned elsewhere, is a painstaking, exhaustive,
accurate account of Norwegian immigration of that
period into Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois.</p>

<p>Other books dealing with special groups or States or
localities are: Axel A. Ahlroth, <i>Svenskarne i Minnesota—Historiska
Anteckningar</i> (Westervik, 1891); Rasmus B.
Anderson, <i>The First Chapter of Norwegian Immigration,
1821-1840</i>, a prolix, padded, but valuable volume; and <i>Tale
ved Femtiaarsfesten, for den Norske Udvandring til Amerika</i>
(1875); John H. Bille, <i>A History of the Danes in
America</i> (<i>Trans. Wis. Acad. of Sciences, Arts, and Letters</i>,
XI, 1896), a short pamphlet; Tancred Boissy, <i>Svenska
Nationaliteten i Förenta Staterna</i> (Göteborg, 1882), a reprint
of correspondence in <i>Sydsvenska Dagbl. Snällposten</i>;
J. W. C. Dietrichson, <i>Reise blandt de Norske Emigranter i
“de forenede Nordamerikanske Fristater”</i> (Stavanger
1846, and reprinted Madison, 1896), a historical and contemporary
description of the early settlements, and <i>Nogle
Ord fra Prædikestolen i Amerika og Norge</i> (1851); Robert
Grönberger, <i>Svenskarne i St. Croix-Dalen, Minnesota</i>
(1879), an early and reliable piece of work; George
Kæding, <i>Rockfords Svenskar—Historiska Anteckningar</i>
(1885); Knud Langeland, <i>Nordmændene i Amerika—Nogle
Optegnelser om de Norskes Udvandring til Amerika</i>
(1889),—one of the very best of the books on the Norwegians;
C. F. Peterson (see also Eric Johnson), <i>Sverige i
Amerika—Kulturhistoriska och Biografiska Teckningar</i>
(1898); Johan Schroeder, <i>Skandinaverne i de Forenede
Stater og Canada, med Indberetninger og Oplysninger fra
200 Skandinaviske Settlementer</i> (1867),—full of the most
valuable information about life and conditions in the
Northwest; Ole Rynning, <i>Sandfærdig Beretning om Amerika
til Oplysning og Nytte for Bonde og Menigmand</i>
(Christiania, 1838),—a remarkably clear, compact, and
influential pamphlet; Carl Sundbeck, <i>Svenskarna i Amerika,
Deras Land, Antal, och Kolonien</i> (Stockholm, 1900);
Alfred Söderström, <i>Minneapolis Minnen</i> (1899), an excellent,
extensive, newspaper-like description of the life and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
activities of the Scandinavians in that half-Norse city; Alfred
Strömberg, <i>Minnen af Minneapolis</i> (1902); <i>Underretning
om Amerika, fornemmeligen de Stater hvori udvandrede
Normænd have nedsat sig, ... udgivne af X</i>
(Skien, 1843); M. Ulvestad, <i>Normændene i Amerika, deres
Historie og Record</i> (1907); P. S. Vig, <i>Danske i Amerika</i>
(1900); Johs. B. Wist, <i>Den norske Indvandring til 1850, og
Skandinaverne i Amerikas Politik</i> (1884?),—a small but
suggestive pamphlet.</p>

<p>On the Bishop Hill colony, the best authorities are:
Michael A. Mikkelsen, <i>The Bishop Hill Colony, a religious
communistic Settlement in Henry County, Illinois</i> (<i>Johns
Hopkins University Studies</i>, X, No. 1, 1892)—the most
convenient work in English, based almost entirely on Norelius,
and on Johnson and Peterson, <i>Svenskarne i Illinois</i>,
Johnson being a son of the founder, Eric Janson; Emil
Herlenius, <i>Erik-Jansismens Historia ett Bidrag till Kännedomen
om det Svenska Sektväsendet</i> (Jönköping, 1900);
<i>History of Henry County, Illinois</i> (1877); <i>Erick Jansismen
i Nord Amerika</i> (Gefle, 1845); Hiram Bigelow, <i>The
Bishop Hill Colony</i> (No. 7 of the <i>Publications of the Illinois

<p>The number of historical books and pamphlets relating
to the States, counties, cities, and settlements in the Northwest
is very great, and for the larger part, unsatisfactory
but indispensable. They have usually been written by
ambitious but untrained persons, either as commercial
ventures, advertising agencies, or as the pastime of retirement
or old age; they are nevertheless full of suggestive
data; now and then one is found which can be trusted
throughout.</p>


<p class="center">A. MINNESOTA</p>

<p>First in importance for the Scandinavian settlements
in Minnesota are four county histories: <i>History of Fillmore
County, including Explorers and Pioneers of Minnesota</i>

of Houston County, etc.</i> (1882); Martin E. Tew and Victor
E. Lawson and J. E. Nelson, <i>Illustrated History and Description
and Biographical Review of Kandiyohi County,
Minnesota</i> (1905),—easily the best local history relating
to Scandinavian settlement, as well as one of the latest and
most comprehensive. Closely connected with this last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>

<p class="center">TRAVELS AND GUIDE BOOKS</p>

<p>Good accounts of conditions in the European kingdoms,
as those conditions were related to emigration at
different periods, are: Samuel Laing, <i>A Tour of Sweden
in 1838: comprising Observations on the Moral, Political
and Economic State of the Swedish Nation</i> (London 1839),
and <i>Journal of a Residence in Norway during the Years
1834, 1835 and 1836</i> (2nd ed., 1837); Charles Loring Brace,
<i>The Norsk Folk; or a Visit to the Homes of Norway and

Life, or Svea and her Children</i> (1894); J. F. Hanson, <i>Light
and Shade from the Land of the Midnight Sun</i> (1903).</p>

<p>Of the numerous travelers through the American
Northwest, noting the Scandinavian settlements or the
conditions affecting them, the most significant is Frederika
Bremer, <i>The Homes of the New World—Impressions
of America</i> (In translation from the Swedish, 3 vols., London,
1853), the work of an educated, alert, sympathetic
Swedish lady already noted as a writer. Others of special
worth are C. C. Andrews, <i>Minnesota and Dakota: in Letters
Descriptive of a Tour through the Northwest in the
Autumn of 1856</i> (1857); Johan Bolin, <i>Beskrifning öfver
Nord Amerikas Förenta Stater</i> (Wexjö, 1853); A. Budde,

<p>Of guidebooks and handbooks for emigrants and immigrants
there is a great number, in English, Swedish,
and Norwegian; some issued from philanthropic motives,
some by interested States, railroad companies, land companies,
and counties, and some by the United States. Only
those that directly affected the Scandinavians, or that are
typical of a period, are mentioned, and the list is not meant
to be exhaustive of titles or editions. Some of the publications
by States, might well have been put under the heading
of State documents.</p>

<p>One of the typical, widely circulated English handbooks
is William Cobbett, <i>The Emigrant’s Guide, in ten
Letters addressed to the Taxpayers of England, containing
Information of every Kind, necessary to Persons who are
about to emigrate</i> (London, 1829). A similar Norwegian
pamphlet is L. J. Fribert, <i>Haandbog for Emigranter til
Amerikas Vest</i> (Christiania, 1847), or J. R. Reierson,
<i>Veiviser for norske Emigranter til de forenede nordamerikanske
Stater och Texas</i> (Christiania, 1844, reprinted in
America, 1899). The United States issued a guide: Edward
Young, <i>Special Report on Immigration; accompanying
Information for Immigrants</i> (1871), reprinted in 1872,
with editions in French and German. Other works are:
Frederick B. Goddard, <i>Where to Emigrate and Why</i>
(1864); and Edward Young, <i>Information for Immigrants,
relative to Prices and Rentals of Land, etc.</i> (1871).</p>

<p>For Wisconsin, the most significant and helpful are:
<i>Beskrivelse over Staten Wisconsin: Dens Klimat, Jordbund,
Agerdyrkning, samt Natur- og Kunstprodukter.
Udgivet efter Legislaturens Ordre af Statens Immigrations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Department</i> (1870); K. K. Kennan (joint agent in Europe
for the Wisconsin State Board of Immigration and the
Wisconsin Central Railroad, without expense to the former),
<i>Staten Wisconsin, dens Hjælpekilder og Fordele for
Udvandreren</i> (1884)—in several editions, and also in
Swedish; C. F. J. Moeller, <i>Staten Wisconsin, beskreven
med særligt Hensyn til denne Stats fortrinlige Stilling som
et fremtidigt Hjem, for Emigranter fra Danmark, Norge,
og Sverige</i> (1865); <i>Wisconsin,—What it offers to the Immigrant.
An official Report published by the State Board
of Immigration of Wisconsin</i> (1879)—many editions, and
in various languages.</p>

<p>For Minnesota: Girart Hewitt, <i>Minnesota: Its Advantages
to Settlers</i>, etc. (1868),—seven editions, one being
published by the State; Hans Mattson, <i>Minnesota och
dess Fordelar for Indvandreren</i> (1867); <i>Minnesota as a
Home for Emigrants</i> (1886),—in Norwegian and Swedish
also.</p>

<p>For other States: <i>Resources of Dakota,—an Official
Publication compiled by the Commissioner of Immigration</i>
(1887), later editions dealing with the two States formed
from the Territory of Dakota; Fred. Gerhard, <i>Illinois as it
is: its History, Geography, Statistics</i>, etc. (1857); <i>Iowa:
the Home for Immigrants</i> (1879), also in Swedish, Norwegian,
German, and Dutch.</p>


<p class="center">BIOGRAPHIES AND AUTOBIOGRAPHIES</p>

<p>Several of the books mentioned under special histories,
like those of Norelius, Langeland, Dietrichson, and
Schroeder, have much autobiographical material in them;
while others, such as the volumes of O. N. Nelson and
C. F. Peterson and the county histories, contain hundreds
of brief biographies. The more important and illuminating
autobiographies are: Hans Mattson, <i>Minnen</i> (Lund, 1890)
and the same in translation, <i>Reminiscences, the Story of
an Emigrant</i> (1891), an interestingly naïve account of the
varied activities of a prominent politician and business
man; Gustaf Unonius, <i>Minnen från en sjutton-årig Vistelse
i Nordvestra Amerika</i> (2 vols., Upsala, 1862), a graphic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
account of the first years of Swedish settlement, by one of
its highly educated leaders, and <i>Bihang till Minnen</i>
(Stockholm, 1891). With less direct bearing, is W. H. C.
Folsom, <i>Fifty Years in the Northwest</i> (1888); H. P. Hall,
<i>H. P. Hall’s Observations, being more or less a History of
Political Contests in Minnesota from 1843 to 1904</i> (1904);
John Reynolds, <i>My Own Times, embracing also the History
of My Life</i> (Chicago, 1855); Stephen Grellet, <i>Memoirs</i>
(edited by Benj. Seebohm, 2 vols., 1860); and S. B. Newman,
<i>Pastor S. Newmans Sjelfbiografi</i> (1890).</p>

<p>Four biographies stand out above the others: T. N.
Hasselquist, <i>Lefnadsteckning af E. Norelius</i>; L. A. Stenholt,
<i>En Studie af Knute Nelson</i> (1896); Chr. O. Brohough,
and I. Eisteinsen, <i>Kortfattet Beretning om Elling Eielsens
Liv og Virksomhed</i> (1883); and L. M. Björn, <i>Pastor
P. A. Rasmussen</i> (1905). Other biographies of less significance
for this study are: C. J. Rosenberg, <i>Jenny Lind
in America</i> (1851); Sara C. Bull, <i>Ole Bull</i> (1883); W. C.
Church, <i>Life of John Ericsson</i> (2 vols., 1890).</p>

<p>Other collected biographies, including Scandinavians,
are: J. C. Jensson, <i>American Lutheran Biographies</i>
(1890); <i>Men of Minnesota</i> (1902); F. G. Flower, <i>Biographical
Souvenir Book</i> (1899), relating to North Dakota
alone; <i>Prominent Democrats of Illinois</i> (1899); H. A.
Tenney, and D. Atwood, <i>Fathers of Wisconsin</i> (1880);
C. J. A. Erickson, “Memories of a Swedish Immigrant,”
<i>Annals of Iowa,</i> April, 1907.</p>


<p class="center">RELIGION, EDUCATION, AND THE PRESS</p>

<p>No attempt is made here at a bibliography of the
abundant polemical religious literature, nor of the sermons
and proceedings of church conventions, nor of denominational
year books, further than to show the material
contributing to this volume. In similar manner, a limit
is put upon the list of catalogs and publications of colleges
and seminaries, and upon the periodicals and newspapers
of which the number is very large.</p>

<p>A very recent and excellent volume dealing with Norwegian
progress and culture in America is <i>Norsk-Amerikanernes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Festskrift, 1914</i> (Chief Editor, Johs. B. Wist)
which was prepared as an American contribution to the
celebration of the centennial of Norwegian independence.
Important chapters are devoted to the press (noted below),
the churches, schools, literature, and men in public or
political life, each being the work of a careful scholar.</p>

<p>The most valuable volumes dealing with the religious
histories of Scandinavian settlement are E. Norelius, <i>De
Svenska Luterska Församlingarnas och Svenskarnes Historia
i Amerika</i> (1890) and, of almost equal worth, for
Norwegian church history, Th. Bothne, <i>Kort Udsigt over
det Lutherske Kirkearbeide blandt Nordmændene i Amerika</i>
(1898), being a separate made up of a section of
“Norske Kirkeforhold i Amerika,” pp. 815-903, of H. G.
Heggtveit, <i>Illustreret Kirkehistorie</i>. Good brief sketches
of various denominations are embodied in O. N. Nelson,
<i>History of the Scandinavians</i>, already noted. The most
important of the other works are: R. Anderson, <i>Den
Evangelisk Lutherske Kirkes Historie i Amerika</i> (1889);
and <i>Emigrantmissjonen, Kirkelig Vejledning for Udvandrere</i>

<p>Various numbers of <i>Normands-Forbundet</i>, published
in Christiania, have contained noteworthy articles, besides
those mentioned elsewhere in this bibliography, dealing
with American conditions: S. Sondresen, “Den norsk-amerikanske
farmer” (1908); J. Dieserud, “Nordmændenes
deltagelse i de Forenede Staters politiske liv” (1908); M.
Alger, “Re-immigrationen” (1913); Av. Kand. Gottenborg,
“Hjemvandte norsk-amerikanere, deres livsforhold i
Amerika og i Norge efter hjemkomste” (1913); O. K. Winberg,
“Degenererer Nordmænd i Amerika” (1910).</p>

<p>Three small novels contain particularly graphic accounts
of the life and social conditions among the Norwegian
settlers: P. O. Strömme, <i>Hvorledes Halvor blev
Prest</i> (1893), one of the very best pictures of pioneer immigrant
family life; H. A. Foss (translated by J. J. Skordalsvold),
<i>Tobias, a Story of the Northwest</i>, an exaggerated
account of intemperance; and Sigurd H. Severson, <i>Dei
möttes ve Utica. En paa personlig Iagttagelse grundet
Skildring af Livet i ældre Norsk-Amerikanske Settlementer</i>
(1882).</p>

<p>The number of newspapers and other periodicals for
the Scandinavians in the United States yearly given in G.
P. Rowell Co., <i>American Newspaper Directory</i>, has varied
in recent years from 125 to 140, while the total of short-lived
and long-lived publications of the same sort would
pass 200. The following list includes those periodicals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>

<p class="center">STATISTICS OF IMMIGRANTS FROM DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN.</p>

<p>The number of alien passengers and immigrants from the Scandinavian countries arriving in the United States, 1820-1913, together
with the total number of alien arrivals according to the statistics of the United States, and, where available, of the Scandinavian kingdoms.
The figures from 1820-1840 are at best a safe minimum. The earlier figures reported by the Scandinavian kingdoms, given in round numbers,
are probably estimates based upon partial data. See United States <i>Reports of the Bureau of Commerce and Navigation, Annual Statistical
Abstracts</i> and the report of the Dillingham Commission (1911); Sundbärg, <i>Bidrag til Utvandringsfrägen frän Befolkningsstatistisk Synpunkt;</i>

show no such name as the “Restauration,” and American statistics give
the total Scandinavian immigration as 35, of whom 14 are credited to
Norway.</p></div>

a letter written in Hellen in Norway, May 14, 1836: “If good reports
come from them (certain emigrants about to sail) the number of emigrants
will doubtless be still larger next year. A pressing and general
lack of money enters into every branch of business, stops, or at least
hampers business, and makes it difficult for many people to earn the
necessaries of life. While this is the case on this side of the Atlantic,
there is hope of abundance on the other, and this, I take it, is the chief
cause of this growing disposition to emigrate.”</p></div>

that Eielsen had built a log house on his own land, and held religious services
in the loft, with the possibility of the formation of a congregation.

workman amount to $625, and one may safely presume that every able-bodied
workman contributes every year 1/5 of his earnings to the increase
of national wealth. Taking into consideration the period of time of a
full working capacity of emigrants according to their age, and considering
the much less working capacity of females, and the cost of raising the
children which they bring with them, one may fairly presume that, during
the last few years, not only considerable cash capital has been taken to
the United States by emigrants, but that every one of them carries to
that country, in his labor, a capital which may be estimated at $1200. The
total value of the labor thus conveyed to the United States during the last
five years, may therefore be estimated at about $700,000,000. No wonder
that the United States of America prosper.” <i>Hamburger Handelsblatt</i>,

without illiteracy. The contrast of these figures with the percentages
of illiteracy of some other European countries is very striking.
In 1890 the percentage of illiterates in Austria was 40%, in Hungary, 54%,
in Italy, in 1897, among conscripts, 37.3% (reduced from 56.7% in 1871),

Bancroft, <i>Utah</i>, 441, 431; Montgomery, <i>The Work Among the Scandinavians</i>,
8. Mr. Montgomery, the superintendent of Minnesota for the
American Home Missionary Society (1886), laments the fact that very
large numbers of the Scandinavians “have become converts to Mormonism,
and have ‘gathered’ to Utah,” and adds further: “I have before me
the official statistics of the Mormon church (not easily obtained) giving
a report of their missionary work in Scandinavia for each year from
1851 to 1881. They report that their converts in these lands during these
thirty-one years reached the enormous total of 132,766 persons, and that of
these 21,000 emigrated to Utah.” From a beginning of four elders of the
Mormon church at work in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in 1850, the
force increased to sixty-one missionaries at work in 1881.</p></div>

account of a visit to Dane County, Wisconsin, where ‘one of the Formalists,’
after five years of labor had failed to bring much enlightenment.
“There are some four thousand or more Norwegians in one settlement,
about three-quarters of whom are members of this man’s church, and the
rest are sheep without a shepherd. They had had preaching there for the
last five years, but such gross immorality I had never witnessed before....
We have no reasonable ground to hope that a single individual
of those three thousand souls is converted to God; for all are intemperate
and profane.... Of all I saw (and I saw a great many) two out of
three were intoxicated, or had been drinking so that it was offensive to
come within the sphere poisoned by their breath; and of every two I
heard talking together one or both profaned their Maker.”</p></div>

    <li>Reference pages have been standardized with “ff” following

    of this style in the original work.</li>
    <li>Both “reelected” and “re-elected” appear in the
    original work. They have been standardized as “re-elected”.</li>
    <li>Both “post-office” and “postoffice” appear in the original
    work. Both spellings have been retained.</li>
    <li>Page 59: “was sent out with eight others, in March, 1851” is
    inconsistent with “returned at once from California and became
    the head of the colony after February, 1851.” This was verified
    with the page scan of the original work.</li>
